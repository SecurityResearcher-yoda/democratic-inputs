""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient.

""Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.""

Statement:  
""Combating global warming demands both leveraging existing technologies, like renewable energy and electric vehicles, and pursuing innovative solutions, while considering systemic and lifestyle adjustments.

Opinion (what person believes):
""My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.""

Statement:  
""Combating global warming demands both leveraging existing technologies, like renewable energy and electric vehicles, and pursuing innovative solutions, while considering systemic and lifestyle adjustments. Cooperation among governments, industries, and individuals is essential to face this challenge effectively. However, it's crucial to recognize the uncertainty of the outcome and the importance of collective resilience and creativity in addressing this complex issue.""

Statement:  
""While currently available technologies such as renewable energy and electric vehicles play a crucial role in transitioning away from fossil fuels, it is evident that systemic changes, along with innovative breakthroughs, are needed to address the multifaceted challenges of climate change comprehensively. This requires cooperation from governments, industries, and individuals in terms of adopting new regulations, changing consumption patterns, and reconsidering values on a global scale. However, it's important to acknowledge that solving global warming is not guaranteed and will ultimately depend on our collective resilience and creativity in tackling this existential threat.""

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient.

Statement:  
""I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Opinion (what person believes):
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Statement:  
""While currently available technologies such as renewable energy and electric vehicles play a crucial role in transitioning away from fossil fuels, it is evident that systemic changes, along with innovative breakthroughs, are needed to address the multifaceted challenges of climate change comprehensively. This requires cooperation from governments, industries, and individuals in terms of adopting new regulations, changing consumption patterns, and reconsidering values on a global scale. However, it's important to acknowledge that solving global warming is not guaranteed and will ultimately depend on our collective resilience and creativity in tackling this existential threat.""
