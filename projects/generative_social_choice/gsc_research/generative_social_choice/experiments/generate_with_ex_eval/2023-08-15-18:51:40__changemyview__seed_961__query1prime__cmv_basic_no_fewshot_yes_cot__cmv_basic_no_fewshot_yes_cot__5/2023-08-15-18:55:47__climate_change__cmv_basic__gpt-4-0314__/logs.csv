""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Statement:  
""This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead.

""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

Opinion (what person believes):
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Statement:  
""This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Statement:  
""There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is.

This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else. 



Opinion (what person believes):
""My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.""

Statement:  
""While we have some technologies to fight global warming, we need a unified effort that includes systemic overhauls, political willingness, and continued innovation to truly make a sustainable impact on our planet.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

Opinion (what person believes):
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement).

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Statement:  
""This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality.

We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Statement:  
""We must utilize existing technologies, foster systemic transformation, and engage in individual actions to effectively combat global warming as we strive for a sustainable future.""

""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Statement:  
""This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Statement:  
""There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting.
