However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.

- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.

- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.

This concludes the list of people. Now here is the list of forbidden statements:

- We need to focus on implementing the green technologies that already exist, while also supporting systemic changes in our economy and lifestyle, to tackle global warming effectively and ensure a sustainable future for our planet.
- Investing in renewable technologies and implementing economic and lifestyle transformations can help mitigate global warming, but we must overcome the political challenges and societal reluctance to make these changes happen.
- A combination of fully utilizing the green technologies we have now, systemic changes in our societies, and continued innovation is crucial for addressing global warming and ensuring humanity's survival.

3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground?
4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make. Of course, not everyone can be fully represented by a single statement, I just one you to generate one statement which fully represents the most people possible. (Don't worry that some people will not be represented yet, I will ask you later to generate statements which represent the remaining people.) Finally there is one more aspect to the challenge: the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below in the forbidden list.
