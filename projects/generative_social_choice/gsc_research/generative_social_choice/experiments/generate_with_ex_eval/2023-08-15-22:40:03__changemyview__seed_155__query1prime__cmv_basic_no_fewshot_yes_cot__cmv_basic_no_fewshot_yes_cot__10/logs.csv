It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.","Below is a list of people with various opinions on a topic. Follow the following steps: 
1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground?
4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make. Of course, not everyone can be fully represented by a single statement, I just one you to generate one statement which fully represents the most people possible. (Don't worry that some people will not be represented yet, I will ask you later to generate statements which represent the remaining people.) Finally there is one more aspect to the challenge: the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below in the forbidden list.  If your statement at all resembles a statement in the forbidden list, that is very bad. So this is the challenge: you must represent the participants in the above list, with a statement which is nothing like anything in the below forbidden list. Now here is the list of people and their opinions:

- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.

This concludes the list of people. Now here is the list of forbidden statements:

- We must pursue a combination of technological advancements, government regulations, and lifestyle changes to mitigate the effects of climate change and shift toward sustainable living, recognizing that this will require cooperation and collaboration across communities and nations.
- We need to focus on systemic changes in economic structures, prioritizing sustainability and circular economies, while exploring possible technological breakthroughs to effectively address climate change and its multifaceted origins.
- Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar power and promoting sustainable lifestyle changes is vital, but climate change can only be effectively tackled with systemic changes in our economy and society, prioritizing collaboration and innovation for a greener future.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.

This concludes the list of people. Now here is the list of forbidden statements:

- We must pursue a combination of technological advancements, government regulations, and lifestyle changes to mitigate the effects of climate change and shift toward sustainable living, recognizing that this will require cooperation and collaboration across communities and nations.
- We need to focus on systemic changes in economic structures, prioritizing sustainability and circular economies, while exploring possible technological breakthroughs to effectively address climate change and its multifaceted origins.
- Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar power and promoting sustainable lifestyle changes is vital, but climate change can only be effectively tackled with systemic changes in our economy and society, prioritizing collaboration and innovation for a greener future.
- Our only chance to save the planet from climate change is by overturning the existing systems of power and consumerism, while also embracing cutting-edge technologies, to build a more sustainable, community-oriented future.
- Rather than waiting for a technological panacea, we should actively work on systemic changes, embrace green innovations, and engage in community-driven solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change.
- As a society, we ought to focus on transformative changes in our economic structures, political policies, and individual behavior to collectively pave the path towards a sustainable future, while still remaining open to innovative breakthroughs to combat climate change.

4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions.

It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make. Of course, not everyone can be fully represented by a single statement, I just one you to generate one statement which fully represents the most people possible.

- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.

This concludes the list of people. Now here is the list of forbidden statements:

- We must pursue a combination of technological advancements, government regulations, and lifestyle changes to mitigate the effects of climate change and shift toward sustainable living, recognizing that this will require cooperation and collaboration across communities and nations.
- We need to focus on systemic changes in economic structures, prioritizing sustainability and circular economies, while exploring possible technological breakthroughs to effectively address climate change and its multifaceted origins.
- Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar power and promoting sustainable lifestyle changes is vital, but climate change can only be effectively tackled with systemic changes in our economy and society, prioritizing collaboration and innovation for a greener future.
- Our only chance to save the planet from climate change is by overturning the existing systems of power and consumerism, while also embracing cutting-edge technologies, to build a more sustainable, community-oriented future.
- Rather than waiting for a technological panacea, we should actively work on systemic changes, embrace green innovations, and engage in community-driven solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change.
- As a society, we ought to focus on transformative changes in our economic structures, political policies, and individual behavior to collectively pave the path towards a sustainable future, while still remaining open to innovative breakthroughs to combat climate change.
- "": ""Implementing existing clean energy technologies like solar power, while working toward transformative changes in our economic and societal structures, is critical to mitigating the planetary harm caused by climate change and fostering sustainable living.""}
- Addressing climate change requires not only innovative technological advancements, but also transformative systemic changes and community-driven solutions that challenge the current power structures and consumer mindset.
- Averting the disastrous consequences of climate change requires not only embracing clean technologies we have today but also striving to change our societal structures and foster widespread cooperation and unity.

Now start following the steps. Your output should be a Python dictionary with key-val pairs: ""STEP 1"": """"""<writing for step 1>"""""", ""STEP 2"": """"""<writing for step 2>"""""", ""STEP 3"":, """"""<writing for step 3>"""""", ""STEP 4"": """"""<writing for step 4 (VERY IMPORTANT just put the statement, nothing else, and remember to not write anything similar to any statement in the forbiddden list)>"""""". Format your Python dict with curly braces at the beginning and end and NEVER write newlines. Only write the Python dict and nothing else.","We must strive to slow down climate change by embracing our existing clean technologies and focusing on systemic changes in economic structures, as well as empowering local communities to foster sustainability and innovation.",2023-08-15-22:49:27,"{""STEP 1"": ""The topic being discussed is climate change and global warming.
