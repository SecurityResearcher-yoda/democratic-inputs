Given these opinions expressed by the participants, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.
","- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

- Global warming is a complex issue that cannot be solely solved by a single technological breakthrough or incremental changes alone. Addressing climate change requires a combination of efforts, including systemic transformations in our economic structures, new regulations, consumer behavior, and diverse innovations. It is essential for us to shift our mindset, elect leaders who prioritize human well-being, and work together as a society to find holistic and sustainable solutions.
- Tackling climate change effectively requires a multifaceted approach, which includes both incremental lifestyle changes and significant innovations in technology and policy. Addressing the root causes demands a shift in our societal mindset and values, as well as collective action to elect responsible leaders and implement systemic changes. While no single solution guarantees success, combining diverse strategies and embracing cooperation can help humanity adapt and mitigate the dire consequences of global warming.
- Solving global warming requires more than just technological breakthroughs or small lifestyle changes; it calls for a major shift in mindset, societal structures, and collaborative efforts. We must recognize the importance of systemic transformations, community-driven solutions, and electing leaders who genuinely prioritize environmental concerns. Our collective actions and willingness to adapt can potentially pave the way for a more sustainable future, even amidst the uncertainties and challenges we face.

Given the opinions expressed by the participants, and the list of statements you are NOT allowed to write, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.

Addressing climate change requires a combination of efforts, including systemic transformations in our economic structures, new regulations, consumer behavior, and diverse innovations. It is essential for us to shift our mindset, elect leaders who prioritize human well-being, and work together as a society to find holistic and sustainable solutions.
- Tackling climate change effectively requires a multifaceted approach, which includes both incremental lifestyle changes and significant innovations in technology and policy. Addressing the root causes demands a shift in our societal mindset and values, as well as collective action to elect responsible leaders and implement systemic changes. While no single solution guarantees success, combining diverse strategies and embracing cooperation can help humanity adapt and mitigate the dire consequences of global warming.
- Solving global warming requires more than just technological breakthroughs or small lifestyle changes; it calls for a major shift in mindset, societal structures, and collaborative efforts. We must recognize the importance of systemic transformations, community-driven solutions, and electing leaders who genuinely prioritize environmental concerns. Our collective actions and willingness to adapt can potentially pave the way for a more sustainable future, even amidst the uncertainties and challenges we face.
- Addressing climate change goes beyond individual steps or a single innovative breakthrough; it requires an integrated approach involving systemic changes, diverse technologies, and collaborative efforts. Our collective willingness to modify our way of life, prioritize environmental concerns, and strive for adaptive solutions will determine our success against global warming. Only by embracing a holistic and transformative mindset can we effectively tackle this complex issue.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

- Global warming is a complex issue that cannot be solely solved by a single technological breakthrough or incremental changes alone. Addressing climate change requires a combination of efforts, including systemic transformations in our economic structures, new regulations, consumer behavior, and diverse innovations. It is essential for us to shift our mindset, elect leaders who prioritize human well-being, and work together as a society to find holistic and sustainable solutions.
- Tackling climate change effectively requires a multifaceted approach, which includes both incremental lifestyle changes and significant innovations in technology and policy. Addressing the root causes demands a shift in our societal mindset and values, as well as collective action to elect responsible leaders and implement systemic changes. While no single solution guarantees success, combining diverse strategies and embracing cooperation can help humanity adapt and mitigate the dire consequences of global warming.
- Solving global warming requires more than just technological breakthroughs or small lifestyle changes; it calls for a major shift in mindset, societal structures, and collaborative efforts. We must recognize the importance of systemic transformations, community-driven solutions, and electing leaders who genuinely prioritize environmental concerns. Our collective actions and willingness to adapt can potentially pave the way for a more sustainable future, even amidst the uncertainties and challenges we face.
- Addressing climate change goes beyond individual steps or a single innovative breakthrough; it requires an integrated approach involving systemic changes, diverse technologies, and collaborative efforts. Our collective willingness to modify our way of life, prioritize environmental concerns, and strive for adaptive solutions will determine our success against global warming. Only by embracing a holistic and transformative mindset can we effectively tackle this complex issue.
- Addressing climate change demands more than just hoping for a miraculous technological breakthrough; it calls for a blend of societal mindset shifts, innovative solutions, and cooperative efforts. We must focus on electing leaders committed to addressing environmental issues and fostering systemic transformations, while also embracing individual and community changes. The multifaceted approach is the key to mitigating the consequences of global warming and moving towards a sustainable future.
- Combating climate change requires a combination of systemic changes, technological innovations, and collective action from individuals, communities, and governments. Emphasizing a shift in mindsets, values, and power structures is crucial for meaningful progress. Only through a multifaceted approach can we navigate the challenges of global warming and work towards a more sustainable future.

Addressing climate change requires a combination of efforts, including systemic transformations in our economic structures, new regulations, consumer behavior, and diverse innovations. It is essential for us to shift our mindset, elect leaders who prioritize human well-being, and work together as a society to find holistic and sustainable solutions.
- Tackling climate change effectively requires a multifaceted approach, which includes both incremental lifestyle changes and significant innovations in technology and policy. Addressing the root causes demands a shift in our societal mindset and values, as well as collective action to elect responsible leaders and implement systemic changes. While no single solution guarantees success, combining diverse strategies and embracing cooperation can help humanity adapt and mitigate the dire consequences of global warming.
- Solving global warming requires more than just technological breakthroughs or small lifestyle changes; it calls for a major shift in mindset, societal structures, and collaborative efforts. We must recognize the importance of systemic transformations, community-driven solutions, and electing leaders who genuinely prioritize environmental concerns. Our collective actions and willingness to adapt can potentially pave the way for a more sustainable future, even amidst the uncertainties and challenges we face.
- Addressing climate change goes beyond individual steps or a single innovative breakthrough; it requires an integrated approach involving systemic changes, diverse technologies, and collaborative efforts. Our collective willingness to modify our way of life, prioritize environmental concerns, and strive for adaptive solutions will determine our success against global warming. Only by embracing a holistic and transformative mindset can we effectively tackle this complex issue.
- Addressing climate change demands more than just hoping for a miraculous technological breakthrough; it calls for a blend of societal mindset shifts, innovative solutions, and cooperative efforts. We must focus on electing leaders committed to addressing environmental issues and fostering systemic transformations, while also embracing individual and community changes. The multifaceted approach is the key to mitigating the consequences of global warming and moving towards a sustainable future.
- Combating climate change requires a combination of systemic changes, technological innovations, and collective action from individuals, communities, and governments. Emphasizing a shift in mindsets, values, and power structures is crucial for meaningful progress. Only through a multifaceted approach can we navigate the challenges of global warming and work towards a more sustainable future.
- Climate change cannot be overcome solely by technological breakthroughs or minor lifestyle adjustments; it calls for a comprehensive strategy involving systemic changes and collaboration on all levels. Success against global warming depends on our willingness to evolve our mindsets and values, elect leaders who prioritize the environment, and engage in diverse solutions. The combined efforts of society, policy, and innovation are crucial to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure a sustainable future.

Statement:  
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact.

""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Each participant has expressed an opinion, and your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. To illustrate what I mean by ""feel represented"", I give you a few examples in the following.  Each example consists of a participant's opinion, a statement, and the answer to the question whether the participant who expressed the opinion would feel represented by the statement:



Opinion (what person believes):
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Statement:  
""Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.""

Statement:  
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

{agent_opinion_list}

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

{excluded_comments_list}

Given the opinions expressed by the participants, and the list of statements you are NOT allowed to write, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences. 
","- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.
