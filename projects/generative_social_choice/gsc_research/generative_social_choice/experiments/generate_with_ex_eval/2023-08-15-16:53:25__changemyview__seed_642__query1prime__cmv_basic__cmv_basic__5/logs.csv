These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

{agent_opinion_list}

Given these opinions expressed by the participants, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.
","- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation.

- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.

We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below:

This multifaceted approach will involve systemic changes in our economic structures, government regulation, and shifts in individual behavior. Cooperation and collective effort, rather than relying solely on a single 'fantastic' solution, will be key to mitigate the impacts of global warming on our planet.
- Tackling global warming demands a combination of both existing solutions and the potential for novel innovations, alongside structural and systemic changes in various sectors of our society. This includes government regulation, individual lifestyle adjustments, and a shift in power dynamics and collective thinking. Ultimately, the challenges of climate change call for courage, cooperation, and a shared determination to reshape our relationship with the planet and each other.
- Addressing climate change demands a collaborative effort to implement existing technology, invest in innovative breakthroughs, and enact systemic transformations while evolving our mindsets. As a society, we must unite and work towards sustainable changes in both government regulation and individual behavior. Recognizing the complexity of the issue, we must be open to diverse solutions and accept that a single 'fantastic' breakthrough alone will not be sufficient to overcome global warming.

- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

- Addressing climate change requires both the implementation of existing technologies and the pursuit of innovative breakthroughs. This multifaceted approach will involve systemic changes in our economic structures, government regulation, and shifts in individual behavior. Cooperation and collective effort, rather than relying solely on a single 'fantastic' solution, will be key to mitigate the impacts of global warming on our planet.
- Tackling global warming demands a combination of both existing solutions and the potential for novel innovations, alongside structural and systemic changes in various sectors of our society. This includes government regulation, individual lifestyle adjustments, and a shift in power dynamics and collective thinking. Ultimately, the challenges of climate change call for courage, cooperation, and a shared determination to reshape our relationship with the planet and each other.
- Addressing climate change demands a collaborative effort to implement existing technology, invest in innovative breakthroughs, and enact systemic transformations while evolving our mindsets. As a society, we must unite and work towards sustainable changes in both government regulation and individual behavior. Recognizing the complexity of the issue, we must be open to diverse solutions and accept that a single 'fantastic' breakthrough alone will not be sufficient to overcome global warming.
- Combating climate change necessitates a multi-faceted approach, leveraging existing technology, promoting innovative breakthroughs, and embracing systemic changes in our social and economic structures. Individuals, governments, and industries must collaborate and adapt in order to tackle the diverse sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, addressing this global crisis demands both collective action and a shift in our perspectives to prioritize sustainability and long-term well-being for ourselves and the planet.

Given the opinions expressed by the participants, and the list of statements you are NOT allowed to write, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences. 
","Tackling global warming requires not only embracing available technology and potential revolutionary breakthroughs, but also fundamentally altering societal structures and personal behaviors. A comprehensive approach, including cooperation at all levels and a shift in values, is crucial for mitigating our planet's environmental issues.
