1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions.

1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground?
4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make. Of course, not everyone can be fully represented by a single statement, I just one you to generate one statement which fully represents the most people possible. (Don't worry that some people will not be represented yet, I will ask you later to generate statements which represent the remaining people.) Finally there is one more aspect to the challenge: the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below in the forbidden list.  If your statement at all resembles a statement in the forbidden list, that is very bad.

The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.

Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.

So this is the challenge: you must represent the participants in the above list, with a statement which is nothing like anything in the below forbidden list. Now here is the list of people and their opinions:

- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.

This concludes the list of people. Now here is the list of forbidden statements:

- In order to make progress on global warming, we need a combination of new technologies, changes in human behavior, and cooperation on regulations, while remaining vigilant against vested interests and political exploitation.
- Addressing global warming and its challenges requires systemic transformations alongside new technologies, as well as a shift in individual behavior and a collective effort to overcome political obstacles.
- To effectively combat global warming, we must embrace both technological innovations and systemic shifts in our lifestyles, while recognizing the potential influence of politics and financial interests on our ability to address the challenge.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

- In order to make progress on global warming, we need a combination of new technologies, changes in human behavior, and cooperation on regulations, while remaining vigilant against vested interests and political exploitation.
- Addressing global warming and its challenges requires systemic transformations alongside new technologies, as well as a shift in individual behavior and a collective effort to overcome political obstacles.
- To effectively combat global warming, we must embrace both technological innovations and systemic shifts in our lifestyles, while recognizing the potential influence of politics and financial interests on our ability to address the challenge.
- Tackling global warming will involve embracing innovations, adjusting our daily habits, and fighting against counterproductive politics, while acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the variety of sources contributing to it.
- To help mitigate global warming, society needs a mix of technological advancements, transformative green policies, and individual commitments to change.
- Global warming demands a multifaceted approach, encompassing technological innovation, human behavior adjustments and addressing political roadblocks that hinder tackling environmental challenges effectively.

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing

- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.","Below is a list of people with various opinions on a topic. Follow the following steps: 
1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground?
4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make. Of course, not everyone can be fully represented by a single statement, I just one you to generate one statement which fully represents the most people possible. (Don't worry that some people will not be represented yet, I will ask you later to generate statements which represent the remaining people.) Finally there is one more aspect to the challenge: the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below in the forbidden list.  If your statement at all resembles a statement in the forbidden list, that is very bad. So this is the challenge: you must represent the participants in the above list, with a statement which is nothing like anything in the below forbidden list. Now here is the list of people and their opinions:

- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.

This concludes the list of people. Now here is the list of forbidden statements:

- In order to make progress on global warming, we need a combination of new technologies, changes in human behavior, and cooperation on regulations, while remaining vigilant against vested interests and political exploitation.
- Addressing global warming and its challenges requires systemic transformations alongside new technologies, as well as a shift in individual behavior and a collective effort to overcome political obstacles.
- To effectively combat global warming, we must embrace both technological innovations and systemic shifts in our lifestyles, while recognizing the potential influence of politics and financial interests on our ability to address the challenge.
- Tackling global warming will involve embracing innovations, adjusting our daily habits, and fighting against counterproductive politics, while acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the variety of sources contributing to it.
- To help mitigate global warming, society needs a mix of technological advancements, transformative green policies, and individual commitments to change.
- Global warming demands a multifaceted approach, encompassing technological innovation, human behavior adjustments and addressing political roadblocks that hinder tackling environmental challenges effectively.
- A successful response to global warming necessitates a mixture of cutting-edge technologies, sweeping overhauls of economic systems, and a change in individual habits, while monitoring the impact of political and financial interests on our efforts.
- To combat global warming, society must navigate the interplay of technological advancements, political motivations, and individual efforts while exploring transformative changes in our economic systems and lifestyles.
