Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Opinion (what person believes):
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Statement:  
""There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting.

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else. 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient.

Statement:  
""Addressing global warming entails maximizing the potential of existing technologies while acknowledging the potential for future innovations. Simultaneously, a collective shift in socio-economic structures, government regulations, and individual behaviors is vital. Our response to climate change must involve unified determination and adaptability, despite differing perspectives and uncertainties.""

Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Statement:  
""There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else. 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Tackling global warming demands the utilization of current technologies alongside shifts in societal structures and mindset. It is essential to acknowledge the role of leaders, communities, and individual actions while anticipating potential future breakthroughs. The ultimate solution will involve a blend of these factors as we collectively adapt to prevent further climate catastrophe.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Statement:  
""There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech.

""This view sets up a false dichotomy.

This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else. 



Opinion (what person believes):
""My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.""

Statement:  
""Addressing global warming entails maximizing the potential of existing technologies while acknowledging the potential for future innovations. Simultaneously, a collective shift in socio-economic structures, government regulations, and individual behaviors is vital. Our response to climate change must involve unified determination and adaptability, despite differing perspectives and uncertainties.""

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Opinion (what person believes):
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.""

Statement:
