These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

{agent_opinion_list}

Given these opinions expressed by the participants, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.
","- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

- Addressing climate change effectively requires a combination of existing technological breakthroughs, government regulations, and systemic changes to our society. Small, piecemeal actions can contribute to the overall effort while we continue to search for innovative solutions. However, overcoming our current challenges demands increased cooperation, collective mindset shifts, and the willingness to reevaluate our values and power structures.
- Tackling climate change involves not only implementing existing technological advancements, but also acknowledging the need for systemic changes and government regulations. Small-scale actions should be complemented by cooperative efforts and a shift in societal values. A comprehensive approach, addressing multiple sources of greenhouse gas emissions, is necessary for making meaningful progress in mitigating global warming.
- Effectively combating climate change requires leveraging current technological breakthroughs, fostering systemic transformations, and promoting strong government regulations. A collective approach that unites individual actions with larger societal and economic shifts is indispensable. To make significant progress, we must embrace collaboration, reevaluate our values, and challenge existing power dynamics.

Given the opinions expressed by the participants, and the list of statements you are NOT allowed to write, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.
