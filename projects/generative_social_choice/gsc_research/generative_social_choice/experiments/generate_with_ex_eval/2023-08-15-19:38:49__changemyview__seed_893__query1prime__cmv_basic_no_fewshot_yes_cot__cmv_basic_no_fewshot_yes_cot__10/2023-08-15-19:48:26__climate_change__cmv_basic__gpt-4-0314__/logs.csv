""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""
