These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

{agent_opinion_list}

Given these opinions expressed by the participants, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.
","- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.

- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.

These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

- Acknowledging the advancements in renewable energy and technology that we currently possess, addressing global warming requires not only major systemic changes in our economic structures, government regulations, and societal values, but also the individual efforts and adaptability of people across the globe. The belief in a singular, undeniable technological breakthrough may prove insufficient, as cooperation and collaboration among communities are crucial to achieve long-lasting change. Considering this, the fight against global warming should be a combined effort of innovation, policy shifts, and lifestyle adjustments that respect the planet's natural balance and the lives it sustains.
- The potential to tackle global warming already exists through existing technological advancements in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and more sustainable practices. However, overcoming this challenge will rely on a combination of these technologies, systemic changes, and widespread individual efforts. The battle against global warming demands a collaborative approach, integrating innovation, policy reform, and societal adaptations to safeguard our planet's future.
- Addressing global warming demands a multifaceted approach that harnesses our current technological advancements, systemic transformations, and community-driven efforts. A single breakthrough may not be enough, as collaboration and commitment from governments, industries, and individuals are crucial for meaningful change. Our shared goal should be a harmonious collective effort that respects the planet and its inhabitants, envisioning a sustainable future for all.

- Acknowledging the advancements in renewable energy and technology that we currently possess, addressing global warming requires not only major systemic changes in our economic structures, government regulations, and societal values, but also the individual efforts and adaptability of people across the globe. The belief in a singular, undeniable technological breakthrough may prove insufficient, as cooperation and collaboration among communities are crucial to achieve long-lasting change. Considering this, the fight against global warming should be a combined effort of innovation, policy shifts, and lifestyle adjustments that respect the planet's natural balance and the lives it sustains.
- The potential to tackle global warming already exists through existing technological advancements in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and more sustainable practices. However, overcoming this challenge will rely on a combination of these technologies, systemic changes, and widespread individual efforts. The battle against global warming demands a collaborative approach, integrating innovation, policy reform, and societal adaptations to safeguard our planet's future.
- Addressing global warming demands a multifaceted approach that harnesses our current technological advancements, systemic transformations, and community-driven efforts. A single breakthrough may not be enough, as collaboration and commitment from governments, industries, and individuals are crucial for meaningful change. Our shared goal should be a harmonious collective effort that respects the planet and its inhabitants, envisioning a sustainable future for all.
- While current technological advancements offer promising solutions to mitigate global warming, addressing this complex issue calls for both systemic changes and individual efforts at various levels. Achieving meaningful progress necessitates not only further innovations but also cooperation among governments, industries, and communities. Ultimately, the path to a sustainable future for our planet will require a diverse and united approach, embracing collaboration, policy shifts, and broad societal adaptations.

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

- Acknowledging the advancements in renewable energy and technology that we currently possess, addressing global warming requires not only major systemic changes in our economic structures, government regulations, and societal values, but also the individual efforts and adaptability of people across the globe. The belief in a singular, undeniable technological breakthrough may prove insufficient, as cooperation and collaboration among communities are crucial to achieve long-lasting change. Considering this, the fight against global warming should be a combined effort of innovation, policy shifts, and lifestyle adjustments that respect the planet's natural balance and the lives it sustains.
- The potential to tackle global warming already exists through existing technological advancements in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and more sustainable practices. However, overcoming this challenge will rely on a combination of these technologies, systemic changes, and widespread individual efforts. The battle against global warming demands a collaborative approach, integrating innovation, policy reform, and societal adaptations to safeguard our planet's future.
- Addressing global warming demands a multifaceted approach that harnesses our current technological advancements, systemic transformations, and community-driven efforts. A single breakthrough may not be enough, as collaboration and commitment from governments, industries, and individuals are crucial for meaningful change. Our shared goal should be a harmonious collective effort that respects the planet and its inhabitants, envisioning a sustainable future for all.
- While current technological advancements offer promising solutions to mitigate global warming, addressing this complex issue calls for both systemic changes and individual efforts at various levels. Achieving meaningful progress necessitates not only further innovations but also cooperation among governments, industries, and communities. Ultimately, the path to a sustainable future for our planet will require a diverse and united approach, embracing collaboration, policy shifts, and broad societal adaptations.
- Combating global warming requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses our existing technological advancements, systemic reforms, and collective individual actions. While some may argue that a single breakthrough could solve the issue, a united and holistic effort from governments, industries, and communities is essential for meaningful change. Our responsibility in addressing this crisis lies not only in innovation but also in embracing collaboration and fostering a sustainability mindset.
- Although current technological advancements provide potential solutions to global warming, a single breakthrough may not be sufficient. Instead, both systemic changes and individual efforts across governments, industries, and communities are necessary for substantial progress. Our collective challenge is to embrace innovation, collaboration, and sustainable practices to safeguard the planet and its inhabitants.

Given the opinions expressed by the participants, and the list of statements you are NOT allowed to write, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

","- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

""people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it""

Statement:  
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Climate change is going to be solved by only dealing with its consequences at the last possible second or until it becomes financially inconvenient. 

It's not a coincidence all these oil companies admitted climate change was real the moment they were on the short end of the profit stick and their insurance stopped backing them.""

Statement:  
""There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

These examples hopefully made it clear what it means for participants to ""feel represented"" by a statement. Now I give you a list of participants' opinions, afterwards I will ask you to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented:

{agent_opinion_list}

Remember, your task is to generate a statement such that as many participants as possible in this above list feel represented. However, and this is VERY important, the statement you generate should not be anything close to the statements written below: 

{excluded_comments_list}

Given the opinions expressed by the participants, and the list of statements you are NOT allowed to write, write now a statement such that as many participants as possible feel represented by that statement. Make the statement precise and short, no more than three sentences. 
","- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- Global warming will not be solved.
The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.
