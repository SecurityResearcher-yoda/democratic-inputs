","Taking Students' statements, they can be summarized as follow:
Student 1: Global Languages AND (Environmental Engineering OR Computer Science) - Needs 2 courses
Student 2: Planetary Sciences AND(Global Languages OR Supplemental Resources) -Needs 2 courses
Student 3: Literature AND (Supplemental Resources OR Architecture) - Needs 2 courses
Student 4: (Mechanical Engineering AND Planetary Sciences) OR Mathematics - Needs 2 courses (for first scenario) or 1 course (for second scenario)
Student 5: (Business AND Literature) OR Mathematics - Needs 2 courses (for first scenario) or 1 course (for second scenario)

The key to approach this problem is to select courses that interest multiple students and use the 'OR' options whenever possible because they require fewer courses.
Now, looking at the requirements, 'Mathematics' is a common course included in the choices of Student 4 and Student 5, and it takes only one slot. So, Mathematics is selected as the first course.
  
Next, we need to evaluate the remaining options while bearing in mind the limit of 5 courses. Based on students' preferences, we can see that if we offer 'Literature' and 'Supplemental Resources', both Student 3 and Student 5 would attend the program - taking the total to 3 students. Next, 'Planetary Sciences' is a common course for Student 2 and 4, so adding this course would bring Student 2 to the program. 
  
At this point that leaves one course option which can be used to cater either to Student 1 or Student 4. So we can choose 'Global Languages' to attract Student 1 to the program because, as for Student 4, we would need to offer 'Mechanical Engineering' in addition to 'Planetary Sciences', which is not possible due to the limit of 5 courses. In this way, maximum of 4 students will attend.
  
In conclusion, the best five courses to offer would be 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', and 'Global Languages' because these courses guarantee maximum participation from students based on their given conditions. 

Therefore, the final answer is

","Analyzing students' preferences specifically from Student 1 to Student 5:

Student 1:  They need 'Mathematics and Business' or 'Literature'. This means if both 'Mathematics' and 'Business' are offered or 'Literature' is offered, Student 1 will attend the program.

Student 2: They need 'Supplemental Resources' and either 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Global Languages'. This means 'Supplemental Resources' has to be offered along with at least one more between 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Global Languages' for Student 2 to attend the program.

Student 3: They need 'Business' and either 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Computer Science'. For Student 3 to attend the program, 'Business' has to be offered along with either 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Computer Science'.

Student 4: They need 'Global Languages' and either 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Computer Science'. 'Global Languages' has to be offered along with 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Computer Science' for Student 4 to attend the program.

Student 5: They need 'Literature' and either 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Business'. So, for Student 5 to attend the program, the classes have to offer 'Literature' and either 'Business' or 'Mechanical Engineering'.

First, we aim to satisfy as many students as we can. We select 'Business' because it is common amongst Students 1, 3 and 5.

Next, we select 'Supplemental Resources', which is wanted by Students 2 and 3.

We pick 'Computer Science' next as it satisfies Students 3 and 4.

Then we pick 'Literature' because it is required by Students 1 and 5.

Lastly, we choose 'Mathematics' because Student 1 will only come if both 'Business' and 'Mathematics' are offered, since we didn't offer both 'Literature' and 'Business'.

Final count:
Student 1 will attend (Business and Mathematics are offered.)
Student 3 will attend (Business and Supplemental Resources are offered.)
Student 5 will attend (Literature and Business are offered.)

Thus, three students in total will attend. We cannot satisfy more students. For instance, we could have considered satisfying Student 2, 3 and 4 together, but that would require 6 classes.

Therefore, to get as many students as possible we will offer 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Literature' and 'Mathematics'.

","Let's denote each class with a letter to simplify notation. 

We denote 
A: Computer Science
B: Business
M: Mathematics
ME: Mechanical Engineering
L: Literature
Arch: Architecture
GL: Global Languages
SR: Supplemental Resources
PS: Planetary Science
EE: Environmental Engineering

We can write the students' conditions as follows:

Student 1: (A and B) or PS 
Student 2: M and (L or PS)
Student 3: EE and (A or M)
Student 4: GL and (PS or Arch)
Student 5: SR and (PS or L)

To satisfy all five students we would require more than 5 courses. 

Looking at our options, each student's requirements have commonality with only 1 or none of the other students. 

Observing the courses that are required by more than one student could be of help. 

Computer Science, Mathematics, Literature, Planetary Sciences are all needed by more than one student respectively. 

At most we can satisfy 3 students. We have 3 options for this – satisfy students 1,2,5 or satisfy students 2,3,5 or satisfy students 1,3,4. 

We can choose to satisfy any of these groups – the decision does not affect the number of students. Let's choose to satisfy students 1,2 and 5. 

To satisfy student 1 we need either Computer Science and Business or Planetary Sciences. 

To satisfy student 2 we need Mathematics and either Literature or Planetary Sciences. 

To satisfy student 5 we need Supplemental Resources and either Planetary Sciences or Literature. 

Since we can choose PS to satisfy both student 1 and student 2 and student 5, we are left to choose Business from Student 1's options (as we have already chosen PS and are unable to offer another of their courses), and Supplemental Resources from students 5's options (as we have already chosen PS and are unable to offer another of their courses).

So the school should offer Computer Science, Business, Mathematics, Planetary Sciences and Supplemental Resources.

","Let's try to understand the statements made by each student:

1. Student 1 will attend if 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Planetary Sciences' courses are offered, or 'Mathematics' is offered.
2. Student 2 will attend if 'Environmental Engineering' is offered, and either 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Business' is offered.
3. Student 3 will attend if 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Literature' are offered, or 'Mechanical Engineering' is offered.
4. Student 4 will attend if 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Planetary Sciences' are offered, or 'Environmental Engineering' is offered.
5. Student 5 will attend if 'Mathematics' is offered, and either 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Environmental Engineering' is offered.

Now, we have to find a set of 5 courses that would satisfy the maximum number of students. 

Mechanical Engineering is liked by Student 1, Student 3, and Student 5.
Planetary Sciences is liked by Student 1 and Student 4.
Mathematics is liked by Student 1 and Student 5.
Supplemental Resources is liked by Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4.
Environmental Engineering is liked by Student 2, Student 4, and Student 5.

To satisfy as many students as possible, let's pick five courses as follows:
1. Mechanical Engineering - This makes Student 1, Student 3, and Student 5 happy.
2. Planetary Sciences - This makes Student 1 and Student 4 happy.
3. Mathematics - This makes Student 1 and Student 5 happy.
4. Supplemental Resources - This makes Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4 happy.
5. Environmental Engineering - This makes Student 2, Student 4, and Student 5 happy.

Now, with this selection of courses, let's review the conditions of all students:
1. The courses for Student 1 are fulfilled as all his preferred courses 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences', and 'Mathematics' are offered.
2. The courses for Student 2 are met as 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Supplemental Resources' is offered but 'Business' is not.
3. For Student 3, 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Supplemental Resources' are offered but 'Literature' is not. However, 'Mechanical Engineering' is among the choices which qualifies him to join.
4. The courses for Student 4 are fulfilled as both of his preferred courses 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered.
5. For Student 5, 'Mathematics' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered but 'Mechanical Engineering' is not.

To summarize, with the current selection of courses, all students will attend the program since for everyone at least one of their preferred courses combination is offered.

","Looking at each student's preferences and the constraints (offering 5 subjects only), one might see that:

- The common options between Student 1, 2, 4, and 5 are 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business', and 'Literature'
- Offering 'Planetary Sciences', 'Global Languages', or 'Supplemental Resources' would be specific to attendants 2 and 3 respectively, and it would obstruct the possibility of satisfying another student's preferences with only two remaining spots.
- 'Computer Science' is specific to Student 4 but alongside 'Mechanical Engineering' potentially satisfies two students. 

Here, we need to make a decision: 

- If we choose 'Computer Science', Student 4 will attend. For the remaining spot, no matter which class we choose, no more student will come because all their required classes(right of 'and' operator) are missing at least one. 
- If we don't choose 'Computer Science', adding 'Mathematics' could bring Student 5, but Students 1 and 4 will not attend because at least one of their requirements is not met. Plus, Student 2 won't attend too as he requires 'Supplemental Resources' which we cannot add anymore. 

On balance, 'Computer Science' seems a better choice to have Student 4 rather than 'Mathematics' which would potentially attract Student 5 only. 

Summarizing, offer 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business', 'Literature', 'Architecture', and 'Computer Science'. This way, Students 1 and 4 will definitely attend the program. Unfortunately, no more students can be satisfied with only a single remaining spot.

","First, let's look at what each student is asking for:
1. Environmental Engineering and (Literature or Architecture)
2. Planetary Sciences and (Computer Science or Supplemental Resources)
3. (Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science) or Mathematics
4. Supplemental Resources and (Mechanical Engineering or Global Languages)
5. Environmental Engineering and (Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science)

Since the school can only offer five courses, to get maximum attendance, we need to aim at covering the interests of as many students as possible.

Let's see if we can find common subjects among the students' preferences:
1. Environmental Engineering: Desired by Students 1 and 5.
2. Computer Science: Desired by Students 2, 3, and 5.
3. Mechanical Engineering: Desired by Students 3, 4, and 5.

As we can see, by offering 'Environmental Engineering', 'Computer Science' and 'Mechanical Engineering', we cater to the needs of all 5 students in some way.

Now, there are still two courses left. To optimize further, we should aim at fulfilling the conditional preferences of the students.

For the fourth course, we should consider adding 'Supplemental Resources'. This fulfills a part of the preferences for Students 2 and 4. 

For the final course, we should choose between the following options that would satisfy additional conditions mentioned by different students: Literature, Architecture, Planetary Sciences, Global Languages, or Mathematics. Here, none of them help in satisfying conditions for more than one student. Thus, we can add any of them. For this case, let's go with 'Planetary Sciences' to meet part of Student 2's condition.

Now with choices being: 'Environmental Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources', and 'Planetary Sciences', the following will attend:

1. Student 1 will not attend. Although 'Environmental Engineering' is offered, neither 'Literature' nor 'Architecture' is. 
2. Student 2 will attend. Both 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Supplemental Resources' are offered.
3. Student 3 will not attend. 'Mathematics' is not offered and while 'Mechanical Engineering' is offered, 'Computer Science' is not. 
4. Student 4 will attend. Both 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered. 
5. Student 5 will attend. Both 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Computer Science' are offered. 

So, considering all, we have 3 students attending out of 5 which is maximum attainable with given conditions.

","The process can be broken down into the following steps:
Step 1: Identify all common subjects that if offered, would fulfill the requirements of more than one student. In this case, it would be Environmental Engineering, Business, Supplemental Resources and Computer Science.
Step 2: Analyze if any of the remaining subjects in combination with the common subjects would fulfill the requirements for any of these students.
The condition for each student is:
Student 1: Environmental Engineering + Business or Supplemental Resources.
Student 2: Computer Science + Environmental Engineering or Mathematics.
Student 3: Supplemental Resources + Architecture or Planetary Sciences.
Student 4: Literature + Supplemental Resources or Mechanical Engineering.
Student 5: Global Languages and Planetary Sciences or Business.

From the conditions, it can be seen that offering Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Business, and Supplemental Resources would satisfy Student 1, Student 2, and Student 3.

Step 3: For the fifth subject, since none of the remaining subjects (Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Literature, Architecture, Global Languages, and Planetary Sciences) would provide an increase in students, the school can pick any subject it prefers. 

In order to maximize the number of attendees, students’ preferences to the remaining subjects can be considered and any of the remaining subjects can be chosen as the fifth one. For instance, the school can offer Planetary Sciences, which is in the demand list of Student 5.

Therefore, the courses chosen would be: Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Business, Supplemental Resources and Planetary Sciences. These courses would bring in 3 students.

","The aim is to get as many students as possible to attend the summer program by offering the right courses. This means the school must meet the requirements as stated by the students in their specific ""if and only if"" conditions.

Starting with the courses each student requires:

1. Student 1: Needs Architecture, and either Mathematics or Global Languages. That's two or three subjects of interest depending on how you look at it.
   
2. Student 2: Needs either Business and Planetary Sciences, or Environmental Engineering. Hence, two or three subjects are needed.

3. Student 3: Needs either Computer Science and Planetary Sciences, or Mechanical Engineering. Again, two or three subjects are needed.

4. Student 4: Needs either Global Languages and Environmental Engineering, or Business. Either way, two or three courses are needed.

5. Student 5: Needs Planetary Science and either Global Languages or Computer Science. Two or three subjects are needed.

Given this, the school only has space for five subjects, but each student wants either two or three to attend. It's clear that some overlap is needed between the subjects for the school to accommodate more students.

Noted that ""Planetary Sciences"" is demanded by Student 2, Student 3 and Student 5. So, this course should definitely be offered.

Also, ""Business"" is needed by Student 2 and Student 4. They both also accept another course (Environmental Engineering and Planetary Sciences respectively), so offering Business seems like a good choice. 

""Computer Science"" covers both Student 3 and Student 5, which means the school can cover two students with one course.

Looking at Student 1, the requirement is ""Architecture"" and either ""Mathematics"" or ""Global Languages"". Given that ""Global Languages"" is needed by Student 4 as well, it makes sense to offer ""Global Languages"" instead of ""Mathematics"". 

Finally, the school should also offer ""Architecture"" to cover Student 1.

This means the school should offer 'Planetary Sciences', 'Business', 'Computer Science', 'Global Languages', and 'Architecture'. With these 5 courses, Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 4 and Student 5 would attend the program. While it's not possible to make all of the students happy, this combination ensures that the maximum number of students (all of them, in this case) will attend.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Step 1: Looking at the available options, let's start by observing that 'Computer Science' and 'Business' are only mentioned in Student 2's preferences, and 'Literature' is not mentioned at all. Therefore, it's safe to say that these 3 subjects should not be chosen because choosing 'Computer Science' and 'Business' will only allow one extra student (Student 2) to attend, thus using up 2 of the allowed 5 subjects but increasing the student count by only 1.

Step 2: Working with the remaining subjects, we find that 'Mechanical Engineering' is mentioned by Student 1, Student 3 and Student 5. Therefore, choosing 'Mechanical Engineering' will potentially please these 3 students.

Step 3: Similarly, 'Global Languages' is mentioned by Student 1 and Student 5. Therefore, picking 'Global Languages' as the second subject will possibly please two additional students.

Step 4: The third subject can be 'Planetary Sciences' as it's preferred by Student 3 and Student 4.

Step 5: Now, we have two remaining slots to fill. At this point, we need to make a choice that could appease the most students. Both Student 3 and 5 like 'Environmental Engineering', so this would be the best option as the fourth course.

Step 6: For the fifth course, we have 'Architecture', 'Supplemental Resources', and 'Mathematics' left. out of these, only 'Architecture' would bring an additional student - Student 1. The other two won't bring any new students. Therefore, 'Architecture' is the most logical choice to make as Student 1 will only come if 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Architecture' are offered.

With these choices, Student 1, 3, and 5 will surely attend because their conditions are satisfied. Student 2 and 4 won't attend because their conditions are not satisfied. We can't bring more than 3 students with any other selection of 5 subjects.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Step-by-step explanation:

First, we need to analyze each student's statement to understand their specific requirements. 

1. ""I would attend the program if and only if (Supplemental Resources and Architecture) or Literature is offered."" - This student will attend if either both Supplemental Resources and Architecture, or Literature is offered.
2. ""I would attend the program if and only if Computer Science and (Architecture or Supplemental Resources) is offered."" - This student will attend if both Computer Science and either Architecture or Supplemental Resources are offered.
3. ""I would attend the program if and only if Business and (Architecture or Computer Science) is offered."" - This student will attend if both Business and either Architecture or Computer Science are offered.
4. ""I would attend the program if and only if (Mathematics and Supplemental Resources) or Global Languages is offered."" - This student will attend if either both Mathematics and Supplemental Resources, or Global Languages is offered.
5. ""I would attend the program if and only if (Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science) or Business is offered."" - This student will attend if either both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, or Business is offered.

From the above, we can notice some overlapping subjects that meet conditions for multiple students - namely ""Computer Science"", ""Business"", and ""Supplemental Resources"". 

Next, we choose the subjects based on their frequency among the students' choices:

- Offer 'Computer Science' and 'Supplemental Resources' since these two subjects maximize the number of attendees. This can satisfy the conditions for Student 2 (paired with either 'Architecture' or an additional subject), Student 4 ('Mathematics' needed), and Student 5 (paired with 'Mechanical Engineering').
- Now we must choose the remaining subjects. The choice of 'Architecture' can accommodate Student 1 (alongside 'Supplemental Resources') and Student 2. By also including 'Business', we can satisfy Student 3. 
- We still have a free spot, and neither 'Literature' nor 'Global Languages' can satisfy any additional students, so we pick one arbitrarily.

Based on all the students' conditions, offering the courses 'Computer Science', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Business', and 'Literature' or 'Global Languages' will allow four out of five students to attend the program. Assuming we can't offer more than 5 courses, trying to satisfy the fifth student would consequently not satisfy one or more of the other four students.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","Let's break down step-by-step which requirements are needed for each student to attend the summer program.

1. Student 1: This student will attend if either Environmental Engineering and Computer Science are offered together or if Global Languages is offered. 

2. Student 2: This student prefers Computer Science and either Mechanical Engineering or Supplemental Resources to be offered. 

3. Student 3: This student needs Literature and either Mathematics or Computer Science to be offered.

4. Student 4: They require Architecture and either Business or Mechanical Engineering.

5. Student 5: This student will attend if Architecture and either Computer Science or Global Languages are offered.

A few key observations:

1. Computer Science seems to be a popular subject as it's mentioned by 4 out of 5 students.

2. Architecture is also in demand, mentioned by 2 students.

3. Mechanical Engineering is mentioned by two students as an option.

Synergizing these observations allow us to deduce a possible set of courses that meets the maximum number of students' preferences.

The 5 subjects the school should offer are:

1. Computer Science: This will accommodate Students 1, 2, 3 and 5.

2. Environmental Engineering: This, combined with Computer Science, completes Student 1's requirement.

3. Literature: This is needed for Student 3 along with Computer Science.

4. Architecture: This is needed for Students 4 and 5.

5. The choice of the fifth subject is crucial to satisfy the fourth student's requirement and allow the fifth student to attend. If we choose Business, it will be only for the fourth student. However, if we choose Global Languages, it satisfies the conditions for both Students 4 and 5. Hence, we choose Global Languages.

Just to note, the requirements of Student 2 are impossible to meet simultaneously with the others as offering Mechanical Engineering or Supplemental Resources precludes satisfying Student 4 or 5. 

Therefore, this choice of courses: Computer Science, Environmental Engineering, Literature, Architecture, and Global Languages will attract 4 out of 5 students, which is the maximal attendance we can expect given the constraints.

","We can break down this problem and solve it considering the preferences of each student:

1. Student 1: Attends if ""Supplemental Resources and Planetary Sciences"" or ""Environmental Engineering"" are offered. We can cater to this situation by taking ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Planetary Sciences"" and ""Environmental Engineering"". 

2. Student 2: Attends if ""Environmental Engineering and (Mechanical Engineering or Mathematics)"" is offered. Here, since we already have ""Environmental Engineering"" selected, we need to take either ""Mathematics"" or ""Mechanical Engineering"". We will consider ""Mathematics"" for now, as it opens us up to more options for other students.

3. Student 3: Would attend if ""(Supplemental Resources and Mathematics) or Business"" is offered. They are already satisfied by our selection of ""Mathematics"" and ""Supplemental Resources"".

4. Student 4: Attends if ""Mathematics and (Business or Computer Science)"" is offered. We see that ""Mathematics"" has already been chosen and we still have one option to choose. We cannot choose ""Business"" or ""Computer Science"" because it would exceed our limit of 5 subjects, also the business option would only cover this student.

5. Student 5: Attends if ""Global Languages and (Supplemental Resources or Mathematics)"" is offered. This student cannot be satisfied without exceeding the limit of 5 subjects.

Therefore, the conclusion is to select: ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Environmental Engineering"", ""Mathematics"" and an additional subject which doesn't affect the student attendance like ""Computer Science"". 

Four out of five students will attend the summer program, which is the maximum possible number of students that could attend.

","The process to solve this task involves understanding what each student requires in terms of courses and then selecting the optimal set of courses that satisfies as many students as possible.

Step 1: Understanding Each Student's Preferences

- Student 1 will attend if either ""Supplemental Resources"" and ""Literature"" are both offered, or if ""Architecture"" is offered.
- Student 2 will attend if either ""Computer Science"" and ""Architecture"" are both offered, or if ""Supplemental Resources"" is offered.
- Student 3 will attend if ""Supplemental Resources"" is offered and either ""Mechanical Engineering"" or ""Computer Science"" is also offered.
- Student 4 will attend if either ""Mathematics"" and ""Supplemental Resources"" are both offered, or if ""Architecture"" is offered.
- Student 5 will attend if either ""Mechanical Engineering"" and ""Computer Science"" are both offered, or if ""Environmental Engineering"" is offered.

Step 2: Analyzing The Courses

Here the task is to offer exactly 5 subjects and the majority of students (3) won't even go unless ""Supplemental Resources"" is offered. Also, two students will go if ""Architecture"" is offered.

The only way to satisfy Student 3 who needs 'Supplemental Resources' and either 'Computer Science' or 'Mechanical Engineering' is by offering 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Mechanical Engineering' as this also satisfies Student 5 who needs either 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Computer Science' together or ""Environmental Engineering"". So, these are the first 3 courses to be offered: 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering', and 'Environmental Engineering'

For the remaining two, offering ""Architecture"" will bring in Students 1 and 4, and meeting the limit of 5 subjects. 

Step 3: Deciding The Subjects

The list of subjects to be offered would be: 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Architecture'

Step 4: Finding Out Which Student Will Attend 

Students will attend based on the following preferences: 
- Student 1 will attend because ""Architecture"" is offered. 
- Student 2 will not attend because their preference of (""Computer Science"" and ""Architecture"") or ""Supplemental Resources"" isn't satisfied.
- Student 3 will attend because ""Supplemental Resources"" and ""Mechanical Engineering"" are both offered.
- Student 4 will attend because ""Architecture"" is offered.
- Student 5 will attend because ""Mechanical Engineering"" and ""Environmental Engineering"" are offered.

","Given that the school can only offer five subjects, it is important to note that the students' preferences are somewhat conflicting. Therefore, the school will have to choose the subjects in such a way that the majority of the students are satisfied.

Let's break down each student's preferences:

1. Student 1 will attend if 'Literature' and (either 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Mathematics') are offered.
2. Student 2 will attend if either ('Mathematics' and 'Mechanical Engineering') or 'Environmental Engineering' is offered.
3. Student 3 will attend if either ('Planetary Sciences' and 'Mechanical Engineering') or 'Literature' is offered.
4. Student 4 will attend if 'Mathematics' and (either 'Computer Science' or 'Literature') are offered.
5. Student 5 will attend if 'Business' and (either 'Literature' or 'Supplemental Resources') are offered.

To maximize the number of students, the school needs to prioritize the subjects that appear most frequently in the students' choices.

By examining the students' preferences, it's clear that 'Mathematics', 'Literature', and 'Mechanical Engineering' appear the most. By offering these three subjects, it should satisfy most of the students' preferences.

In addition, offering 'Environmental Engineering' would also satisfy Student 1 and Student 2. Lastly, offering 'Business' with satisfy Student 5.

By offering these five subjects (Mathematics, Literature, Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Business), Students 1, 2, 4, and 5 will attend, maximizing the number of attendees to 4 out of 5. It is not possible to make more students attend because the restrictions on the number of courses, and the way student's preferences are structured, don't allow for all five students to get their exact choice of courses.

","The logic of each student can be break down like this:

Student 1: 
I would attend the program if and only if (Business and Planetary Sciences are offered together) or only Mechanical Engineering is offered.

Student 2: 
I would attend the program if and only if Literature and (Environmental Engineering or Business are offered together).

Student 3: 
I would attend the program if and only if (Literature and Supplemental Resources are offered together) or only Global Languages is offered.

Student 4: 
I would attend the program if and only if Business and (Literature or Mechanical Engineering are offered together).

Student 5: 
I would attend the program if and only if (Architecture and Environmental Engineering are offered together) or only Literature is offered.

To include as many students as possible, the subjects the school should choose are as follows:

- Offer Literature (It satisfies Student 2 and is part of Student 4 and Student 5's preferences).
- Offer Business (It covers Student 1 and is part of Student 4 and Student 2's preferences).
- Offer Mechanical Engineering (It satisfies Student 1 and is part of Student 4's preferences).
- Offer Global Languages (It satisfies Student 3).
- For the 5th subject, it can be Environmental Engineering (It's a necessary part of Student 2 and Student 5's preferences).

These subjects mean that you will definitely get Student 1, 3, and 4 to attend, and Student 2 and Student 5 might attend. 

Offering these subjects will make a potential of all 5 students attend which is the maximum possible because of the complex requirements of the students.

","To solve this problem, we need to ensure maximum number of students attend the program. We need to find an overlap of courses such that more students' conditions are satisfied. This implies that if we choose the courses that are common in more preferences, we can have more students attend the program.

Let's look at each student's statement:

1. Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science or Planetary Science
2. Mechanical Engineering, and (Computer Science or Planetary Science)
3. Mathematics, Architecture or Mechanical Engineering
4. Supplemental Resources, Architecture or Literature
5. Architecture and (Mechanical Engineering or Planetary Science)

From the above mentioned statements, we can see that there are only five subjects which can satisfy the maximum students which are: 

1. Mechanical Engineering: It appears in 3 preferences of students
2. Computer Science: It's a common subject in the first and second student's preference
3. Planetary Sciences: It too occurs in two preferences.
4. Architecture: It appears in 3 preferences.
5. Mathematics: Since we've already covered Computer Science and Planetary Science from the first and second student's preference, only Mathematics from the third student's preference remains. 

Thus, these five subjects are the most common among all the students' preferences and they will be able to satisfy four students: the first, second, third, and fifth.

It's impossible to get all five students to attend because the fourth student will only attend if Literature or both Architecture and Supplemental Resources are offered. Since we can only offer five courses and we've already chosen five (without Literature or Supplemental Resources), no further courses can be added. So

","Step 1: Let's analyze in detail the requirements of each student.

Student 1: Requires EITHER Architecture AND Supplemental Resources (2 subjects), OR Planetary Sciences.
Student 2: Requires EITHER Mechanical Engineering AND Supplemental Resources (2 subjects), OR Computer Science.
Student 3: Requires EITHER Literature AND Mechanical Engineering (2 subjects), OR Planetary Sciences.
Student 4: Requires Literature AND EITHER Architecture OR Mathematics.
Student 5: Requires Environmental Engineering AND EITHER Literature OR Computer Science.

Step 2: Lets map out the common needs

We can't satisfy all the conditions, so we should aim to ensure as many students as possible will attend.

Three courses pop up frequently: Literature, Supplemental Resources, and Planetary Sciences. 

If we offer Literature, we can potentially cover the requisites for Student 3, Student 4, and Student 5 which is 3 out of 5 students.

If we offer Supplemental Resources, we can potentially cover the requisites for Student 1 and Student 2, two more students.

If we offer Planetary Sciences, we cover another condition for Student 3 and for Student 1, but we already counted these students in the previous options.

Step 3: Choosing other courses

Let's pick Literature and Supplemental Resources as the first two courses, as they cover most of the demands.

Looking at the requirements of Student 3, 4, and 5, which we are covering by choosing Literature, and Student 1 and 2 which we are covering by choosing Supplemental Resources, there are no common requirements between these students. 

If we choose Mechanical Engineering as the third course, it will satisfy the condition for Student 3 (who we are already considering), and partially for Student 2, helping us meet their needs. 

If we choose Architecture as the fourth course, it will satisfy the condition for Student 4 (who we are already considering), and partially for Student 1, helping us meet their needs. 

Finally, we need one more subject. Looking at the remaining conditions, Computer Science, Environmental Engineering, Mathematics, and Planetary Sciences could each add one more student. However, taking into account the number of remaining options we can add, we can't add more than one student regardless of what we choose.

Step 4: Making a decision

We will opt for Computer Science, as it's a frequently chosen program.

Final decision: 

OFFERED COURSES: ['Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Architecture', 'Computer Science']

This selection ensures attendance from Students 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

","Let's look at each student's requirements and see if we can find a common thread or if we can fulfill the most requests with a minimum number of subjects.

Step 1 - Evaluating requirements:
Student 1 needs 'Planetary Sciences' and either 'Global Languages' or 'Literature'
Student 2 needs 'Environmental Engineering' or both 'Literature' and 'Mathematics'
Student 3 needs 'Computer Science' and either 'Global Languages' or 'Mechanical Engineering'
Student 4 needs 'Global Languages' and either 'Literature' or 'Architecture'
Student 5 needs 'Computer Science' or both 'Global Languages' and 'Mathematics'

Step 2 - Looking for overlaps:
'Global Languages' is wanted by Students 1, 3, 4, and 5, so it's a great choice for one of the subjects.
'Literature' is wanted by Students 1, 2, and 4, so it's a good choice for another subject.
'Computer Science' is wanted by Students 3 and 5.
'Mathematics' is wanted by Students 2 and 5.
'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', and 'Architecture' are all wanted by one student each.

With only 5 total subjects that can be offered by the school, we can now try to create combinations of subjects that will satisfy a maximum number of students.

Combination 1: 'Global Languages', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Planetary Sciences'
This would satisfy Students 1, 3, 4, and 5. It would not satisfy Student 2.

Combination 2: 'Global Languages', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Environmental Engineering'
This would satisfy Students 2, 3, 4, and 5. It would not satisfy Student 1.

Combination 3: 'Global Languages', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering'
This would satisfy Students 3, 4, and 5. It would not satisfy Students 1 and 2.

In summary, both Combination 1 and 2 satisfy 4 out of 5 students. However, neither combination can be tweaked to satisfy all 5 students because Student 1 and Student 2 require different single-subject courses ('Planetary Sciences' and 'Environmental Engineering', respectively) and can't be satisfied simultaneously.

So, we need to choose one of the first two combinations. Since there's no other criteria, we can choose any. 

Let's go with Combination 1:

","Step 1: Note that three students (1, 2 and 3) have ""Supplemental Resources"" as one of their choices and two students (4 and 5) do not have ""Supplemental Resources"" in their list of preferred courses.

Step 2: In order to allow maximum attendance, it is wise to accommodate ""Supplemental Resources"" since three students have it as an option.

Step 3: Now look into the other options each student has. Student 1 will attend if (Mathematics and Business) are offered. Student 2 will also attend if Mechanical Engineering is offered. Student 3 will attend if Literature is offered

Step 4: This sums to ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Mathematics"", ""Business"", ""Mechanical Engineering"", and ""Literature"". These five subjects accommodate the interest of student 1, 2 and 3. However, there's no space for an extra subject to accommodate student 4 and 5's interests.

Step 5: The reason that more than three students cannot be accommodated is that students 4 and 5 have unique subject combination preferences that do not overlap with each other or with the first three students. If we try to accommodate either student 4 or student 5, we will have to drop one of the first three students because we cannot exceed the limit of five offered subjects.

Therefore, the best decision to attract maximum students is to offer the following courses:

","In order to satisfy as many students as possible, the school needs to find a common ground between the student's preferences. Let's analyze the student's statements:

Student 1 requires ""Computer Science"" and either ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Business"".
Student 2 requires ""Global Languages"" and either ""Architecture"" or ""Literature"".
Student 3 requires either ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Literature"", or ""Business"".
Student 4 requires ""Architecture"" and either ""Literature"" or ""Business"".
Student 5 requires ""Literature"" and either ""Computer Science"" or ""Mechanical Engineering"".

From the beginning, we can observe that ""Literature"" is a popular choice among the students and could potentially be one of the offered subjects.

Taking Literature into consideration:
- Student 2 would need ""Global Language"" and either ""Architecture"" or ""Literature"" but since there is not much demand for ""Global Language"" and ""Architecture"" by the other students, it's less effective to include these subjects.
- Student 3 would need either ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Literature"", or ""Business"", here ""Business"" seems to be a more feasible option as it is a requirement for other students as well.
- Student 4 would require ""Architecture"" and either ""Literature"" or ""Business"", this student could be satisfied by offering ""Literature"" and ""Business"".
- Student 5 would require ""Literature"" and either ""Computer Science"" or ""Mechanical Engineering"", this student could be satisfied by offering ""Literature"" and ""Computer Science"" as ""Computer Science"" is a requirement for other students as well.

Offering ""Computer Science"", ""Business"", and ""Literature"" would satisfy Student 1, Student 4 and Student 5, and partially satisfies Student 3.

Student 1 could be satisfied further by offering ""Planetary Sciences"", but it won't yield any additional attendance from other students. To reach more students, we select Student 3's other requirement: ""Environmental Engineering"".

Now we have 4 courses: ""Computer Science"", ""Business"", ""Literature"", and ""Environmental Engineering"". 

Adding any other course won't add any more students, so we can add any course for the fifth one without affecting the number of attending students. For example, we could add ""Mathematics"".

So according to this analysis, Student 1, Student 3, Student 4, and Student 5 would attend, which is the maximum number of students that we could possibly satisfy with only offering 5 courses.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","This problem can be approached through a process of elimination:

Step 1:
Looking at Student 1 and Student 2's requirements, we can see that Mathematics is essential for both. Hence, Mathematics should be one of the subjects.

Step 2:
Looking at Student 2, 3, 4, and 5's requirements, we can see that Environmental Engineering is essential for all four. Hence, Environmental Engineering should be another subject.

Step 3:
Looking at Student 1's requirement, we need either Literature or Business. For now, let's choose Business because Student 3 also requires it. Hence, Business should be the third subject.

Step 4:
Looking at Student 2's requirement, we see that they are already satisfied since we are offering Math, Environmental Engineering, and Business. Hence, we don't need to include Computer Science. 

Step 5:
Looking at Student 4's requirements, we need either Supplemental Resources or Global Languages. For this decision, we don't have a definitive way to choose, so we will include both to maximize the probability of capturing more students. Hence, Supplemental Resources and Global Languages are the fourth and fifth subjects.

This right now will attract students 1, 2, and 4, as all their conditions are met. However, this will not attract students 3 and 5 because they have requirements that cannot be satisfied with the limited number of classes we can offer.

The combination of Mathematics, Environmental Engineering, Business, Supplemental Resources, and Global Languages seems to be the best to attract the maximum number of students.

So, the final set of courses offered would be :

For example, the last line might look like this:

","First of all, let's analyze all the conditions of the students:

- Student 1: To make the student attend, the school needs to offer Mathematics and either Global Languages or Planetary Sciences.
- Student 2: To make the second student attend, the school needs to offer Supplemental Resources and either Mechanical Engineering or Environmental Engineering.
- Student 3: He needs Planetary Sciences and either Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering to attend.
- Student 4: He needs either both Computer Science and Architecture or Global Languages to attend.
- Student 5: He needs either both Mechanical Engineering and Environmental Engineering or Computer Science to attend.

Looking at these conditions, the best option would be to offer Mathematics and Planetary Sciences to satisfy Student 1 and 3. Add in Mechanical Engineering for Student 3. For Student 5, Computer Science would work, and it would also satisfy Student 4. And to satisfy Student 2, we can offer Supplemental Resources.

There is no way to choose 5 subjects and make all students attend, because some of the conditions (like offering Mechanical Engineering and Environmental Engineering) would require offering more than 5 subjects. However, the chosen subjects will have the most number of students potentially attending (4 out of 5), as follows:

- Student 1 will attend (Mathematics and Planetary Sciences are offered).
- Student 2 will attend (Supplementary Resources and Mechanical Engineering are offered)
- Student 3 will attend (Mathematics/Planetary Sciences and Mechanical Engineering are offered).
- Student 4 will attend (Computer Science is offered).

For example, the last line might look like this:

","First, we need to analyze the preferences of each student to see which subjects have the most interest.

- Student 1: ""Mathematics and (Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science)""
- Student 2: ""Supplemental Resources and (Mathematics or Business)""
- Student 3: ""(Architecture and Business) or Mechanical Engineering""
- Student 4: ""Computer Science and (Architecture or Mathematics)""
- Student 5: ""Global Languages and (Computer Science or Planetary Sciences)""

The most frequently mentioned subjects are:

- Mathematics: 3 times (once by Student 1, once by Student 2, and once by Student 4)
- Computer Science: 3 times (once by Student 1, once by Student 4, and once by Student 5) 
- Mechanical Engineering: 2 times (once by Student 1 and once by Student 3)
- Architecture: 2 times (once by Student 3 and once by Student 4)
- Business: 2 times (once by Student 2 and once by Student 3)
- Global Languages, Planetary Sciences, and Supplemental Resources are each mentioned once.

Given that we can only pick five subjects, Mathematics and Computer Science are fast picks because they're mentioned the most. 

Looking at the student preferences with those two now in mind:

- Student 1 and 4 will attend if Mechanical Engineering is picked as the third option, and Student 3 also gives Mechanical Engineering as an option.
- Student 2 would attend if Supplemental Resources is chosen, but that would only satisfy one student. 
- The third most mentioned courses are Business, Architecture and Mechanical Engineering.
- Choosing Mechanical Engineering has the potential to satisfy three students (Student 1, 3 and 4)
- Both Business and Architecture appear in the choices of two students, but choosing Business would leave us unable to satisfy Student 3's needs because we will not be able to pick Architecture due to the limit of courses we can offer.
- Opting for Architecture could make Student 3 and 4 attend the course.

Given this, the next choice is Mechanical Engineering, because it can potentially make three students attend the program. After that, the choice falls on Architecture. Now we have four courses, Mathematics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture.

For the final course:

- Choosing Business will not entice any new students because Student 2 would also require Supplemental Resources (which we cannot provide), and Student 3 would already be attending the program.
- Choosing Global Languages or Supplemental Resources would each only satisfy one additional student, the fifth and second one respectively.
- Planetary Sciences satisfies none because it is only useful to Student 5 if Global Languages is also offered.

In this case, it would be more beneficial to choose Global Languages since it will allow Student 5 to attend. 

So, at the end, the five subjects that the school should offer are Mathematics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, and Global Languages. These will enable Students 1, 3, 4, and 5 to attend the program. It is not possible to make more students attend without exceeding the limit of five subjects or replacing a subject that brings in more students.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","Step 1: Identifying common subjects:
From the students' statements, we can infer that the subjects ""Literature"", ""Computer Science"", ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Global Languages"", and ""Environmental Engineering"" are most commonly cited as preferred subjects which suggests these are the subjects most likely to attract the greatest number of students.

Step 2: Examining each student's condition:
- Student 1 will attend if Literature and (Business or Computer Science) is offered. This means we need at least Literature and Computer Science because Business is only mentioned by this student. 
- Student 2 will attend if (Global Languages and Environmental Engineering) or Architecture is offered. This means we need Global Languages and Environmental Engineering or Architecture. But we can ignore Architecture, because only this student mentions it. 
- Student 3 will attend if (Mechanical Engineering and Literature) or Supplemental Resources is offered. This means we need Literature and Supplemental Resources, because Mechanical Engineering is only mentioned by this student. 
- Student 4 will attend if (Environmental Engineering and Supplemental Resources) or Computer Science is offered. All these subjects are mentioned by other students too.
- Student 5 will attend if Supplemental Resources and (Global Languages or Computer Science) is offered. All these subjects are mentioned by other students too.

Step 3: Pruning the subjects list:
Based on these conditions, it becomes clear that we need to offer 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Global Languages' because this will attract Students 1, 2, 4 and 5. With only five subjects able to be offered, offering any other subjects would not attract any more students to the program, because each of Student 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5's conditions would be fulfilled.

","In order to find the best list of subjects to offer, we need to evaluate the students' statements:
- Student 1 needs Global Languages and either Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering.
- Student 2 needs Mechanical Engineering and either Mathematics or Business.
- Student 3 needs either Mathematics and Literature, or Computer Science.
- Student 4 needs Business and either Computer Science or Mathematics.
- Student 5 needs Supplemental Resources and either Literature or Environmental Engineering.

Looking for overlaps among the students' requirements, we see that:
- Mathematics is mentioned four times.
- Both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science are mentioned twice.

Therefore, Mathematics should certainly be offered; both Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering should probably be offered as well. 

By selecting these three subjects, we will fulfill:
- The partial requirements of Students 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- None of Student 5’s requirements.

Let’s decide the remaining two subjects:
- If we select Global Languages (for Student 1), no other student benefits. 
- If we select Business (for Student 2), we only satisfy a remaining requirement for Student 4.
- Literature is an option to fulfill Student 3’s requirements, but again, it does not benefit any other student.
- We could select Supplemental Resources (for Student 5) but it does not help any other student.
- The remaining choices are Architecture, Planetary Sciences, or Environmental Engineering, none of which are mentioned by the students.

The best two choices are Business and Global Languages. This way we have Student 1 satisfied (with Global Languages, Mathematics),  Student 2 (with Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics), Student 4 (with Business, Mathematics), and partially satisfy Student 3’s requirement (with Mathematics):

OFFERED COURSES: ['Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Global Languages', 'Business'].

","The main logic is that the school should focus on classes that are preferred by multiple students, especially those that will make a student's attendance possible if ANY of the other classes is offered. 

Starting with the incoming demand, the available classes with their number of mentions are:
- 'Computer Science': 3
- 'Business': 1
- 'Mathematics': 1
- 'Mechanical Engineering': 2
- 'Literature': 2
- 'Architecture': 1
- 'Global Languages': 1
- 'Supplemental Resources': 1
- 'Environmental Engineering': 2

As for the ""minimum set of classes"" that must be offered for a student to attend, they are:
- 'Global Languages' (Student 1)
- 'Literature' (Students 2, 3)
- 'Business' (Student 4)
- 'Environmental Engineering' (Student 5)

This information leads us on to the conclusion that, by offering 'Literature' and 'Environmental Engineering', the school will already cater to three students (2, 3, 5), as long as any of the second subjects quoted by these students is offered.

So, in order to invite these three students, let's offer:
- 'Literature' (Students 2, 3)
- 'Environmental Engineering' (Student 5)

For the remaining two subjects, 'Computer Science' is a class that will satisfy at least one more preference condition for Students 1, 2, and 3, which takes precedence over other subjects. Therefore, 'Computer Science' should be offered.
- 'Computer Science' (Students 1, 2, 3)

By looking at the options left for the fifth subject to offer, none of them will invite another student to join. But since we have to offer 5 subjects, offering 'Mechanical Engineering' would satisfy an extra condition for Student 1 and 4. 

So, the last subject should be:
- 'Mechanical Engineering' (Students 1, 4)

Offering these 5 subjects, a total of 4 students (i.e. Student 1, 2, 3, 5) would choose to attend the summer program. With any other group of 5 classes, we can't invite more than these 4 students.

","Looking at each statement, we can identify the subjects that are required by more than one student to maximize the number of students attending the program.

1. Student 1 and Student 4 require 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Global Languages'
2. Student 2 requires 'Computer Science' and 'Mathematics' or 'Supplemental Resources'.
3. Student 3 requires 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Mathematics'
4. Student 5 requires 'Computer Science' and 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Mathematics'

From this, 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computer Science' and 'Mathematics' seem to be the most requested subjects, with at least two students requiring them. 

Let's assume they offer these three. Then none of the students are satisfied yet, but three out of five still have a chance to be if we pick the next subjects correctly.

Now, let's look at the options. If we pick 'Environmental Engineering' and either 'Global Languages' or 'Planetary Sciences', we even have an overlap, since Student 1 and 4 are fine with either 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Global Languages', and Student 1 and 3 accept 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Planetary Sciences'. 

So our last two subjects to go along with  'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computer Science', and 'Mathematics' should be 'Environmental Engineering' and either 'Global Languages' or 'Planetary Sciences'. 

The choice between 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Global Languages' won't affect the number of students: In both cases, three out of five will attend, more specifically: Student 1, 2, 5 in case of 'Global Languages' and Student 1, 2, 3 in case of 'Planetary Sciences'. It's not possible to make more attend, because they have further requirements that couldn't be met by the remaining subjects. For example, student 2 always requires 'Supplemental Resources', and the other students require some combination of subjects where always 'Business' or 'Literature' or 'Architecture' is neccessary, but no two students have the same requirements among these subjects.

So a possible offer might look like this:

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","In order to maximize the number of students attending, it's essential to analyze the subject requirements of each student and choose the set of 5 subjects that can potentially attract the maximum students.

Step 1: Analyzing statements of each student.

- Student 1: Student 1 requires ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Literature"", or ""Planetary Sciences"". Here, they form two pairs, 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Literature' or the single subject 'Planetary Sciences'.
- Student 2: Student 2 requires ""Business"", ""Literature"", or ""Architecture"".
- Student 3: Student 3 requires ""Global Languages"", ""Mathematics"", or ""Mechanical Engineering"".
- Student 4: Student 4 requires ""Supplemental Resources"" and either of ""Business"" or ""Planetary Sciences"".
- Student 5: Student 5 requires ""Global Languages"" and either of ""Environmental Engineering"" or ""Computer Science"".

Step 2: Observing the statements, we notice a commonality in few students' preferences. 

- Student 1 and Student 4 both require ""Supplemental Resources"", also Student 1 and Student 4 both are happy with 'Planetary Sciences' as a choice. 
- Similarly, 'Literature' is a common choice for Student 1 and Student 2. 

Counting the above commonalities, these two choices makes it possible for 3 students (1, 2, and 4) to attend. 

Step 3: Looking at the requirements of remaining students, 

- Choosing 'Global Languages' and 'Computer Science' can make Student 5 attend.
- Unfortunately, no matter what the 5th subject we choose, Student 3 won't attend because either Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering isn't offered.

So, the five subjects which can maximize the student attendance are Supplemental Resources, Planetary Sciences, Literature, Global Languages, and Computer Science.

","Looking at the conditions given by each student, we can summarize them:

Student 1: 
- Business AND Mathematics
- OR Planetary Sciences

Student 2: 
- Supplemental Resources AND Global Languages	
- OR Mechanical Engineering

Student 3: 
- Global Languages AND (Mathematics OR Planetary Sciences)

Student 4: 
- Mechanical Engineering AND Computer Science
- OR Global Languages

Student 5: 
- Business AND (Global Languages OR Architecture) 

Student 1, 3 and 5 all have course combinations that involve 'Global Languages'. This makes 'Global Languages' a key course to offer because it satisfies the preferences of 3 students. With the goal of attracting the maximum number of students, this choice is best.

Now if we include 'Global Languages', then according to student 3's condition, we must include either 'Mathematics' or 'Planetary Sciences'. Choose Mathematics because it also meets the criteria of Student 1.

Choosing 'Business' next is logical because it meets the criteria of students 1 and 5.

Now, we're left with 2 more slots. To attract the maximum students, it is better to choose 'Machine Engineering' which cover the condition for Student 2 and 4. 

Lastly, we will choose 'Computer Science' to meet the criteria of Student 4.

So the final course list to attract the maximum students is ['Global Languages', 'Mathematics', 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computer Science'].

To verify:
- Student 1 is satisfied (Global Languages, Mathematics, and Business are offered)
- Student 2 is satisfied (Global Languages and Mechanical Engineering are offered)
- Student 3 is not satisfied (Global Languages is offered but Mathematics is also required)
- Student 4 is satisfied (Global Languages, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science are offered)
- Student 5 is not satisfied (Business and Global Languages are offered but the condition is not met)

So, we have 3 of 5 students who would attend, which is the maximum we can have given that the school can offer 5 subjects.

","To solve this problem, we'll systematically organise the courses that each student would want, and see if we can find a maximum overlap between the students. 

Let's look at each student and what they suggest:

Student 1: Planetary Sciences, and either Business or Architecture.

Student 2: Environmental Engineering, and either Literature or Business.

Student 3: Either Architecture & Global Languages, or Planetary Sciences.

Student 4: Computer Science, and either Business, or Supplemental Resources.

Student 5: Either Architecture & Business, or Supplemental Resources.

Looking at these requirements, we see that Business is commonly suggested by Students 1, 4, and 5. Considering it would enable us to have more students attend, it makes sense to include Business in the courses to be offered. 

Planetary Sciences is suggested by Students 1 and 3, so it is a good option to consider. 

Architecture is suggested by Students 1, 3 and 5. So, it makes sense to include Architecture to increase the coverage. 

Computer Science is only suggested by Student 4, so it doesn't make sense to offer this course since it would only draw 1 student.

For our fourth course, if we include Environmental Engineering, we can get Student 2 to attend since we are offering Business as well. If we include Supplemental Resources instead, this would increase the attendance of Students 4 and 5. So, we should include Supplemental Resources.

Finally, for the fifth course, we need to choose between Global Languages and Literature. Since we are already offering Business and Architecture which covers all the classes needed for Student 5, we can rule out Literature. Therefore, by offering Global Languages, we can increase the potential for Student 3 to attend.

Based on this selection, we can see that:

- Student 1 will attend because we're offering Planetary Sciences and either Business or Architecture.
- Student 2 will not attend because we're not offering Environmental Engineering and either Literature or Business.
- Student 3 will attend because we're offering either Planetary Sciences or Architecture and Global Languages.
- Student 4 will attend because we're offering Computer Science and either Business or Supplemental Resources.
- Student 5 will attend because we're offering either Business and Architecture or Supplemental Resources.

We therefore have 4 students that could attend, and it's not possible to get more students to attend with the remaining courses.

","Step 1: Deduce Overlapping Subjects
- If we read carefully, it can be seen that Computer Science and Planetary Sciences are each mentioned in two students' requirements. While Mathematics is mentioned in the requirements of two students, but it needs to be in combination with different courses which makes it less feasible for targeting multiple students.
- Apart from these, each course is mentioned only in the requirement of one student.

Step 2: Selection of First Three Subjects
- As Computer Science and Planetary Sciences are common in the requirements of more than one student, it makes sense to include those in the offered subjects.
- Keeping Mathematics because this is also mentioned twice by students.

Step 3: Deduction from First Three Subjects' Selection
- With the selection of these three subjects, we can fulfill the requirements of Student 1, Student 2, and Student 4 based on their 'if and only if' conditions.

Step 4: Selection of Last Two Subjects
- Now we have to wisely choose the last two subjects to meet the requirements of the remaining students.
- From the conditions, if we offer 'Business' we can have Student 3 attending the program as it has 'Mathematics and Business' as option.
- Student 5 needs any from Global Languages or Planetary Sciences with Mathematics. Planetary Science is already offered, thus fulfilling the needs of Student 5.

Step 5: Total Students Attendance
- Therefore, all five students' requirements are fulfilled with the selection of these 5 subjects and they all will attend the program.

","Let's analyze each student's condition one by one.

1. Student 1 needs ""Computer Science"" and either ""Business"" or ""Supplemental Resources"".
2. Student 2 needs ""Mathematics"" and either ""Computer Science"" or ""Environmental Engineering"".
3. Student 3 needs either ""Planetary Sciences"" and ""Mechanical Engineering"" or ""Mathematics"".
4. Student 4 needs either ""Computer Science"" and ""Environmental Engineering"" or ""Mathematics"".
5. Student 5 needs either ""Supplemental Resources"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Global Languages"".

By looking at the conditions, we see that ""Computer Science"" is in high demand, required by students 1, 2 and 4. We also notice that ""Mathematics"" is also in demand, required by students 2, 3 and 4.

Student 1 needs either ""Business"" or ""Supplemental Resources"" along with ""Computer Science"". If we choose ""Supplemental Resources"", it will also satisfy one of the conditions of student 5.

Student 2 needs either ""Computer Science"" or ""Environmental Engineering"" along with ""Mathematics"". Since we have already chosen ""Computer Science"", no additional course is needed for student 2.

For student 3, even though they mentioned two other subjects, they are also satisfied by having ""Mathematics"" alone without the other two.

Student 4 is already satisfied as we have both ""Computer Science"" and ""Mathematics"".

For Student 5, they need either ""Supplemental Resources"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Global Languages"". As we have chosen ""Supplemental Resources"", we need to add ""Planetary Sciences"" to satisfy this student.

We are left with one more course we can offer. To satisfy the most number of students, we can add ""Global Languages"" as it is the remaining course required by Student 5.

This way, all the students would attend the summer program.

","Step 1: If we try to accommodate all students' preferences, we find that it's not possible. However, looking at the most common subjects, ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Business"", ""Planetary Sciences"", and ""Mathematics"" are repeating.

Step 2: Let's choose these 4 subjects as fixed and for the fifth subject we try to evaluate the students preference to maximize attendance.

- If we choose ""Supplemental Resources"", student 2 will come.
- If we choose ""Architecture"", student 3 will come.
- If we choose ""Computer Science"", student 5 will come.
- It doesn't matter if we choose any other subject as they do not fulfill any student's requirement.

Step 3: As we can see, we can cater to any one more student out of Student 2, 3, and 5 apart from Student 1 who is already satisfied with our chosen 4 subjects. 

Therefore, it doesn't matter which one of ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Architecture"", or ""Computer Science"" we choose as fifth subject in this scenario because with these selections we will have 2 students (student 1 and either of students 2, 3, or 5) attending the program at most given the conditions. It is not possible to make more students attend because of the limited number of subjects we can offer and the students' specific requirements.

For example, we can choose ""Supplemental Resources"" as the fifth subject which will satisfy student 2. The final course combination can be:

","The goal is to find the combination of five courses that will attract the most students. 

First, analyze the course requirements of each student:

Student 1: Environmental Engineering (necessary), and either Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering (one of these is necessary). 

Student 2: Literature (necessary) and either Supplemental Resources or Mathematics (one of these is necessary).

Student 3: Environmental Engineering (necessary), and either Planetary Sciences or Architecture (one of these is necessary).

Student 4: Either both Planetary Sciences and Supplemental Resources or Environmental Engineering alone.

Student 5: Either both Business and Literature or Global Languages alone.

To maximize the number of students that will attend, it makes sense to offer the courses that are necessary for most students.

Let's start with Environmental Engineering since it's necessary for both Student 1 and Student 3, and it can also attract Student 4. This leaves us with four more courses to choose.

Looking at the remaining requirements, it's clear that Mathematics would attract both Student 1 and Student 2. So, this will be the second course to offer. Now we have three more courses to choose.

Literature will attract Student 2 and possibly Student 5 (if Business is offered as well), so this will be the third course to offer.

Since we have already chosen Literature, it would make sense to offer Business as well so that we can also attract Student 5. 

Finally, we can offer Planetary Sciences as the final course to attract Student 3.

This decision will guarantee the attendance of all five students, given that each one's stipulation for attendance has been met.

","Step 1: Analyze every student's demand combination. Identify subjects which appear most frequently across student preferences. 

Observing the statements, we find that Computer Science, Architecture, Planetary Sciences and Global Languages repeatedly show up in the preferences. 

Step 2: Look for overlapping subjects among students' combinations. 

- Student 1 and Student 2 both demand Computer Science, therefore offering it will satisfy at least these 2 students.
- Student 1, Student 2, and Student 5 all require Architecture, therefore offering it will cover the preferences of these 3 students.
- Student 1 and Student 4 prefer Planetary Sciences, hence offering it will attract at least these 2.

Step 3: Analyze for any other possible combination of subjects that can attract more students than the ones already selected. 

- If we offer Global Languages, it will cover the requirements of Student 2 and Student 3 giving us an opportunity to increase the number of students, with one pending subject to offer.

Step 4: Consider the pending subject to be offered in a way that it caters to the maximum students' requirements.

- Now we have one subject left to offer. Offering Mathematics will satisfy Student 5 and Student 4, since both of these students will be interested if either of their choices is satisfied. It is the optimal choice because none of the remaining classes (Business, Literature, Environmental Engineering) will attract more than these two students. 

So, the subjects to be offered should be: Computer Science, Architecture, Planetary Sciences, Global Languages, and Mathematics.

The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Let's break down the requirements for each student:

Student 1: ['Planetary Sciences', 'Architecture'/'Mathematics']
Student 2: ['Mathematics', 'Literature'/'Global Languages']
Student 3: ['Environmental Engineering', 'Computer Science'/'Literature']
Student 4: ['Environmental Engineering', 'Business' / 'Architecture']
Student 5: ['Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science'/'Business']

To maximize student attendance, we first want to check if there are any classes that appear the most across the list.

We see that 'Planetary Sciences' is required by both student 1 and 5; 'Environmental Engineering' is required by both student 3 and 4, and 'Mathematics' is required by both student 1 and 2. 

This means we want to offer these three classes for sure, as it will attract at least 4 students. 

For the last two offerings, we have to make a choice considering the dual requirements. Students 1 and 5 can either prefer 'Architecture' or 'Computer Science' respectively. Students 3 and 4 can either prefer 'Computer Science' or 'Business' respectively.

If we select 'Architecture' as one, it will only make Student 1 attend. Similarly if we select 'Computer Science' it will only make Student 5 attend. Therefore, either selection of these will still give us a total of 5 students attending.
For the last 5th subject, if we select 'Business', it will not only align with preference of Student 4 or 5, but also with Student 3 as well (as Student 3 has a preference of either 'Computer Science' or 'Literature'). 

As in this scenario if we see 'Computer Science' and 'Literature' are only preferred by a single student, 'Business' will be a better choice as it can make two students attend. So, in turn maximizing the attendees to be 6 students.

Therefore, our ideal choices would be:

","Step 1: Analyze the overlapping subjects
Analyzing the subjects, we notice that Computer Science and Literature appear in two statements, so offering these subjects is likely beneficial.

Step 2: Analyze the remaining subjects
We have three remaining spots for the subjects to be offered. By doing so, we now need to maximize the number of students attending. We can do this by carefully analyzing the remaining preferences.

Step 3: Select the subjects
Since we already decided on Computer science and Literature, we can guarantee that Student 2 will attend. Student 1 and 4 can also attend if we offer Architecture, and Student 3 will attend if we offer Mathematics. We now have one spot left, which we can fill with either Mechanical Engineering or Global language to accommodate one more student (either 3 or 4). Since Global Languages also falls under preferences of Student 5, it's better to select Global Languages, thereby potentially making Student 5 to attend.

Step 4: Conclusion
By following these steps, we have maximized the number of students (four in total: Student 1, Student 2, Student 3 and Student 5) that might attend the program based on their stated preferences. Offering any other combination of courses would result in less students attending.

","We need to try and satisfy as many as conditions of the students as possible. 

Looking at the conditions:

A quick observation shows that 'Supplemental resources' is a common subject for Student 2 and Student 3, and also an optional subject for Student 4, so this should be one of the courses.

'Business' is a common subject for Student 1 and Student 2, and also an option for Student 5, hence this should be our second course.

'Global Languages' is a common subject for Student 4, and also an option for Student 3 and Student 5, hence this should be our third course.

'Computer Science' is a crucial subject for Student 5, and also an option for Student 1, and we can confirm that we have already satisfied the other condition for Student 5 (Business or Global languages), hence this should be our fourth course.

Now, we've covered condition of all students atleast once, but we need 'Environmental Engineering' for Student 1 to attend the program, since we have already included 'Computer Science', hence this should be our fifth course.

Given this selection, we would get attendance from Student 1, Student 5 and Student 4. The reason we couldn't get Student 2 and Student 3 to attend is because we had to choose between satisfying conditions for them or for Student 1 and Student 5, because we can only offer 5 courses and we could not cover both their conditions simultaneously, after including the common subjects needed by other students.

","To maximize attendance, the school should pick the classes with the most overlap, looking for trends in what the students would be willing to take.

First, we notice that Architecture appears three times (in Student 2, 3 and 4's statements). It is a good starting point as more students would attend if it is offered. 

Next, we look at what else is required for each student who mentions Architecture. 

Student 2 would only come if Supplemental Resources were also offered.
Student 4 indicates that either Literature or Supplemental Resources would suffice, so Supplemental Resources can cater to both students 2 and 4.
Student 3 requires Mathematics with Architecture. 

Thus, the subjects so far are 'Architecture', 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Mathematics'. 

To continue our selection, we look for what other subjects could cater to more than one student. 

From Student 1 and 5's statements, we see that 'Environmental Engineering' shows up twice. So, this is our fourth subject. 

Student 1 will attend if 'Global Languages' or 'Business' is also offered, and Student 5 will attend if 'Global Languages' or 'Mechanical Engineering' is offered. To cater to both students, the school should offer 'Global Languages'.

So, the final list of subjects would be 'Architecture', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mathematics', 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Global Languages'. 

With this selection, Students 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 will attend as their conditions are met.

This, as it turns out, is all the students, and so it is not possible to make more students attend.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Here's my solution:

Step 1: Analyze the statements:
In order to maximize the number of students, all classes that are required by multiple students should have a higher priority. 

Step 2: Count the classes:
Let's count the occurrences of each class in the students' requirements:
- Computer Science: 2 
- Business: 2
- Mathematics: 1
- Mechanical Engineering: 2
- Literature: 3
- Architecture: 2
- Global Languages: 3
- Supplemental Resources: 0
- Planetary Sciences: 0
- Environmental Engineering: 0

Step 3: Find the top 5 classes:
The top five mentioned classes based on these counts are Literature, Global Languages, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, and either Business or Computer Science. 

Step 4: Check the impact of the last class:
Between Business and Computer Science, we notice that choosing Computer Science would satisfy student 2 and 4, while choosing Business would satisfy students 4 and 5. So it would seem there's a tie. But, if we look closely at the students' conditions, we find:

- If we choose 'Business', although it's a requirement for student 5, but since Global Languages is already chosen and we can't choose 'Architecture' because we can only offer 5 classes, student 5 won't attend. Therefore, only student 4 will be additional if we choose 'Business'.
- If we choose 'Computer Science', it satisfies student 2 (as 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Global Languages' are already chosen), and also satisfies student 4's condition along with 'Literature'. So, choosing 'Computer Science' will lead to two more students attending.

So the best choice for the fifth class would be 'Computer Science'.

Step 5: Finalize:
Based on steps 1 to 4, the offered classes should be Literature, Global Languages, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, and Computer Science. This will result in students 1, 2, 3, and 4 attending.

Even if there are more classes which appear in the students conditions, they depend on more than one subject and as we have a limit to just 5 courses, we won't be able to make more students attend.

","To get the maximum number of students to attend, we need to find the combination of five subjects which covers the maximum number of students' preferences, taking into account their conditions.

1) Student 1: Supplemental Resources, Planetary Sciences, Computer Science
2) Student 2: Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Architecture
3) Student 3: Supplemental Resources, Computer Science, Mathematics
4) Student 4: Mechanical Engineering, Supplemental Resources, Computer Science
5) Student 5: Environmental Engineering, Architecture, Business

Looking at the options, we can see that Computer Science is a condition for three students (1, 3, 4). So it's a good choice to add to the list.

Another subject that appears multiple times is Supplemental Resources (student 1, 3, 4), so we add it as well.

At this point, we have two out of the five subjects: [""Computer Science"", ""Supplemental Resources""]

For the remaining three subjects, it seems that we can only choose between subjects that satisfy the conditions of two students only, not three, because each of the remaining students has different preferences. We can look for subjects that meet the conditions of two students while ensuring we don't include subjects that were previously included for other students in the list of preferences.

So we add Architecture (students 2 and 5), Mathematics (students 2 and 3), and Mechanical Engineering (students 2 and 4).

Our final list of subjects become: [""Computer Science"", ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Architecture"", ""Mathematics"", ""Mechanical Engineering""]

With these five courses, students 1, 2, 3, and 4 will attend since at least one of their conditions is met. Unfortunately, student 5's both conditions cannot be met in this scenario because it involves subjects that are not preferred by other students. Therefore, this is the maximum number of students that can attend with a limitation of five subjects.

","To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of 5 subjects that can accommodate as many students as possible based on their preferences.

The constraints are:
- The school can offer only 5 subjects.
- Each student has specific preferences for the classes they are interested in.

Based on these preferences and constraints, we notice:

- All the students except Student 2 need two subjects to take part in the program.   Student 2 needs either two or just one course (Planetary Sciences) to attend. 
- A few subjects are requested by more than one student (Global Languages, Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Literature)

By focusing on common preferences and trying to maximize the number of students attending, the following 5 subjects will ensure that 4 out of 5 students will attend:

- 'Global Languages': This is required by both Student 1 and Student 2.
- 'Architecture': This is required by both Student 1 and 5.
- 'Literature': This is required by Student 2 and 5.
- 'Computer Science': This is required by Student 3 and Student 4.
- 'Environmental Engineering': This is required by Student 3.

This way, Student 2, Student 1, Student 3, and Student 5 would attend the program. Only Student 4 wouldn't attend because 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Mathematics' isn't available.

Even though we want to maximize the number of students, it's impossible for all students to attend under these conditions because the combinations of subjects needed don't fit within the limit of offering 5 subjects.

Therefore, the final decision is:

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","From the given student statements, we see that 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are mentioned in more than one student's preferences. So, it makes sense to include these subjects in our selection in order to cover multiple student's preferences.

For the fifth subject, either 'Mathematics' or 'Environmental Engineering' could be added because each is required for one student to attend.

Let's break it down:

- Student 1: Requires either 'Business' and 'Computer Science' or 'Literature'. Our potential selected courses cover their requirement as 'Business' and 'Computer Science' are both included.

- Student 2: Requires 'Mathematics' and either 'Business' or 'Planetary Sciences'. Again, our potential selected courses cover their requirement as we've suggested including 'Mathematics'.

- Student 3: Requires either 'Computer Science' and 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Business'. Our potential selection doesn't quite cover their full requirement because we've not selected 'Environmental Engineering'.

- Student 4:  Requires 'Planetary Sciences' and either 'Computer Science' or 'Mechanical Engineering'. Our potential selected courses cover this as all three are included.

- Student 5: Requires either 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Global Languages' or 'Mechanical Engineering'. Our potential selected courses also cover this requirement as 'Mechanical Engineering' is included.

By including 'Mathematics' instead of 'Environmental Engineering', we can satisfy four out of the five students. If we include 'Environmental Engineering' instead, we would only satisfy three students. Therefore, the choice of five subjects to satisfy the most students would be: 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Mathematics'.

","Let's first lay out the requirements of each student.

1. Student 1: Computer Science AND (Literature OR Mathematics)
2. Student 2: Architecture AND (Business OR Supplemental Resources)
3. Student 3: Environmental Engineering AND (Computer Science OR Global Languages)
4. Student 4: (Environmental Engineering AND Planetary Sciences) OR Global Languages
5. Student 5: (Computer Science AND Business) OR Planetary Sciences

We need to maximize the number of students who will attend, but the school can only offer 5 subjects. 

From the above preferences, we can see that 'Computer Science' is popular, as it is preferred by three students - Student 1, Student 3 and Student 5. So we should certainly include 'Computer Science'.

Let's now look for other subjects that can encourage most students to enroll. Student 1 also requires either Literature or Mathematics. Student 5 also has a preference for Business and as Student 2 also wants either Business or Supplemental Resources, offering 'Business' can be beneficial.

After picking 'Computer Science' and 'Business', we're left with 3 more subjects to offer. 
Student 2 requires 'Architecture' and Student 3 requires 'Environmental Engineering'. We can include both of these courses.

We now have one last spot. We're left with choices among Literature, Mathematics, Supplemental Resources, Global Languages, Planetary Sciences. Supplying 'Planetary Sciences' will invite Student 5 but 'Global Language' will bring Student 3 as his requirement of either 'Computer Science' or 'Global Languages', is already met.

This situation leads to a dilemma as we cannot please everyone. So, we will pick 'Planetary Sciences' because it attracts a new student (Student 5) rather than 'Global Languages' which could potentially get Student 3 to enroll, but Student 3 is already partially covered by Environmental Engineering. 

So after selecting these 5 subjects: 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Planetary Sciences', the students who will attend are Student 1 (partial), Student 2 (partial), Student 3 (partial), and Student 5.

It is not possible to make more students attend because of the overlapping preferences and the limit of 5 subjects.

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.

","The trick to this problem is that some of the conditions require two subjects while some are met by only offering one subject. We have to provide 5 subjects, and we want to make sure as many students as possible will attend. It would be ideal if we could meet the requirements for all the students, but this would require offering 9 distinct subjects, which is not possible. 

Let's break down the conditions:

| Student       | Condition 1             | Condition 2       |
| ------------- |:-----------------------:| -----------------:|
| Student 1     | Global Languages        | Business          | 
|               | Planetary Sciences      |                   | 
| Student 2     | Mechanical Engineering  | Computer Science  | 
|               | Literature              |                   | 
| Student 3     | Environmental Engineering| Business         | 
|               | Computer Science        |                   | 
| Student 4     | Planetary Sciences      | Literature        | 
|               | Global Languages        |                   | 
| Student 5     | Architecture            | Business          | 
|               | Environmental Engineering|                   | 

It can be seen that ""Business"" meets the requirements of three of the students [1,3,5]. The rest of the conditions need two subjects each, thus the optimal solution will always ensure four students attend. 

In order to maximize the number of students attending, we should definitely offer ""Business"". 

Next, we need to choose two pairs of subjects from the remaining four. The pairs should be chosen in such a way that they do not contain a common subject.

Out of the remaining conditions, the pair ""Global Languages"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" satisfies the first condition, and the pair ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Architecture"" satisfies the fifth condition. 

Choosing these two pairs would result in four students attending the program: Student 1, Student 3, Student 4 and Student 5. 

Unfortunately, it is not possible to make all five students attend, as this would require offering more than 5 subjects.

That said, this combination guarantees the highest possible attendance, which is four out of five students.

","In order to maximize attendance, let's try to satisfy as many students' conditions as possible within the constraint of offering only 5 courses.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. First observe the course preferences of each student. We see that Literature and Computer Science are most preferred, and they are a part of the statements of 4 students. 

2. So to satisfy the maximum number of students we definitely need to offer Literature and Computer Science which takes up 2 of the 5 slots.

3. Once we've selected these two, we can satisfy Student 2 by offering Architecture (as he wants either Literature and Architecture or Computer Science), Student 4 by offering Business (as he wants either Literature and Computer Science or Business), and Student 3 by offering Business (they are ok as long as Computer Science and either Business or Literature is offered).

4. That leaves us with one more subject slot. We can see that offering Global Languages will satisfy Student 1 (who needs either Literature and Global Languages or Supplemental Resources). This makes him the 4th student to be satisfied, which seems to be maximum we can get.

5. So, this ensures that we are covering the maximum number of students, i.e., four out of 5. Unfortunately, there is no combination that satisfies all students because of the varied subject interests and the limit of 5 subjects that can be offered.

To summarize, the students who will attend includes, 
- Student 1 as 'Literature' and 'Global Languages' are offered
- Student 2 as 'Literature' and 'Computer Science' are offered
- Student 3 as 'Computer Science' and 'Business' are offered
- Student 4 as 'Literature' and 'Computer Science' are offered.

Hence the subjects to be offered should be 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', 'Business', and 'Global Languages'.

","Since the school has the offer of exactly 5 subjects and each student needs at least 2 subjects to attend, the goal should be to get as many students to attend. Hence, we should identify the common subjects among these students. 

Computer Science seems to be a popular course, as it has been requested by both Student 1, 3, and 4.  
Business is another big contender with at least 2 students (Student 1 and Student 3) requesting it. 
Environmental Engineering is requested by Student 3 and 4. 

The first three subjects will cater to Student 1 (with either Business and Computer Science), Student 3 (with Computer Science and Business or Computer Science and Environmental Engineering) and Student 4 (with Computer Science and Environmental Engineering or Computer Science and Mathematics). 

Mathematics, mentioned by Student 2 and 4, is another course that should be offered. Offering Mathematics would cater to Student 4 (with either Computer Science and Environmental Engineering or Computer Science and Mathematics). 

To accommodate one more student, we need to offer one more subject. Since Business has already been chosen, offering Global Languages can cater to Student 1 (with Business and Global Languages, even if Computer Science is not available). Offering Planetary Sciences would cater to Student 5 (with Literature and Planetary Sciences, even if Architecture is not specified), but Literature was not among the chosen courses, so this option can't be considered. 

So, the fifth subject offered should be Global Languages. This way, the school will be able to cater to Student 1, 3, and 4 completely.

","In these statements, consider each course individually and see how many times it appears:

- Architecture: 2
- Business: 2
- Global Languages: 2
- Computer Science: 3
- Environmental Engineering: 2
- Literature: 2
- Supplemental Resources: 1
- Planetary Sciences: 1

It seems that Computer Science appears the most, so let's definitely offer it. If we offer Computer Science, it satisfies one of the conditions for Student 3, 4 and 5. 

Business, Architecture and Environmental Engineering appear the same number of times (2), but offering Business would help satisfy conditions for two students (Student 1 and Student 4), whereas choosing the other two subjects would only accommodate one student.

Let's also observe that Architecture is needed by both Student 1 and Student 2, who haven't been satisfied yet. So I'd choose Architecture too.

Offering Global Languages will make Student 1 and 3 satisfied.

The last course is trickier to choose as we left with Literature. However, choosing it would satisfy one of the conditions for Student 4. But also, if we offer Environmental Engineering, we could satisfy a condition for Student 3. We want to choose the course that will bring in the most students. If we choose Literature, we will only draw in Student 4. However, if we choose Environmental Engineering, we will draw in Student 2 and solidify the chances of Student 3, who already met one of its conditions by offering Global Languages.

Let's offer these 5 course: 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages' and 'Environmental Engineering'. This will ensure that Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, and potentially Student 5 will attend, which is more than what could be achieved with other combinations.

The reason we cannot have all 5 students attend the program is due to the fact that the combinations of courses required by the students require offering more than 5 courses.

Student 4: (Business AND Supplemental Resources) [Both are necessary] OR Mechanical Engineering [This one is enough alone]
Student 5: (Planetary Sciences AND Environmental Engineering) [Both are necessary] OR Mathematics [This one is enough alone]

Next, we can see that Planetary Sciences is a common and necessary preference for Student 1, 2, and 5. For Student 3, it can also be a chosen course, making it a favourable course to offer.

Mechanical Engineering can meet the requirements for both Student 2 and 4. For Student 4 it can be only course offered that would make them attend, making it a highly favourable course to offer.

Mathematics is a common preferred course for Student 1, 3 and 5, making it another favourable course.

This leaves us with 2 more courses to choose. Given student 3's preference, one of them must be Global Languages. Then, to satisfy the stated conditions of the most students, the final course should be Literature, as it meets the requirement of Student 2.

The students who will attend based on this combination are: Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4. This maximizes the number of students who will participate in the summer program considering the preferences. It seems impossible to choose 5 classes and have all 5 students attend the program because of the constraints imposed by Students 4 and 5.

","The maximum number of students we can get to attend given the constraints is four, as at least one student's preferences are incompatible with those of the others. Here's a step by step analysis of how I arrive at this:

1. Let's consider the preference of Student 5 who prefers either (Environmental Engineering and Literature) or Architecture. If we choose to offer Environmental Engineering and Literature (in order to satisfy her demand), we wouldn't be offering Business, which cancels out the attendance of Student 1, whose demands cannot be met anymore. Also, we could alternatively offer Architecture to satisfy Student 5's preference, but doing so would still conflict with the demands of Student 3, who wants Literature and (Mathematics or Supplemental Resources). So Student 1 and 3's attendance are mutually exclusive. Hence, one of them can't attend.

2. Let's aim to get the maximum attendance of 4 students. We'll opt for the Environmental Engineering and Literature combination to satisfy Student 5 since Business and Architecture (Entry requirements of the other students) aren't involved and more attendance can be achieved this way.

3. The demand of Student 4 (Planetary Sciences and (Environmental Engineering or Mechanical Engineering)) can also be easily met by offering Planetary Sciences, Environmental Engineering is already on offer.

4. The demand of Student 3 (Literature and (Mathematics or Supplemental Resources)) can be met by offering Mathematics.

5. Now, we have only the space to offer one more subject. If we offer Business, we can get Student 1 to attend but not Student 2. If we offer Architecture, we can get Student 2 to attend. However, as Global Languages or Computer Science are not being offered, offering Business will not work out. So, we should offer Architecture

In conclusion, the best way to maximize student attendance, given the stipulations, is to offer 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Mathematics' and ‘Architecture'.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Looking at the students' statements, we can find subjects that are commonly mentioned:

1. Supplemental Resources is mentioned by Student 1 and Student 2.
2. Architecture is mentioned by all students except Student 1.
3. Mechanical Engineering is mentioned by Students 2, 3, and 5.
4. Business is mentioned by Students 3, 4, and 5. 

Also, entries under the first list of each student's statement ensure their commitment upon its complete availability. Thus, the above analysis narrows down the possible selection to ['Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business]. 

Then, looking at the additional subject required by each student, we find these to be 'Literature', 'Environmental Engineering'. 
Choosing either one of these wouldn't increase the number of students attending, since both are only needed by one student each. It might be strategic to offer one of these depending on the remaining spot from the earlier 4 chosen subjects.

1. Choosing 'Literature' would please Student 1 giving a total of 4 satisfied students.
2. Choosing 'Environmental Engineering' would please Student 4 also giving a total of 4 satisfied students.

For completeness, we'll consider the remaining potential subjects not listed in students' demands, 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Global Languages'. By offering any of these, we don't increase the count of satisfied students since none of them asked for these subjects. 

After analyzing, we can see the best choices consist of the four common subjects, plus either Literature or Environmental Engineering or 'Any other remaining subject as per the availability/resources of the school'.
Thus, 4 students would attend the program in the best scenario. It is not possible to make more students attend, as each remaining student demands a combination of subjects that by losing at least one already chosen would reduce the satisfaction of other students.

","The first step is to break down each student's condition into logical sequences:

1. Mechanical Engineering and Planetary Sciences, or Mathematics. There are 3 subjects and if we choose the first two the student will attend, if we choose Mathematics the student will attend regardless of the other courses.

2. Mechanical Engineering, and either Planetary Sciences or Literature. If we choose any two of these subjects, the student will attend. 

3. Global Languages, and either Planetary Sciences or Supplemental resources. Again, choosing any two here will make this student attend.

4. Planetary Sciences, and either Environmental Engineering or Architecture. 

5. Either Literature and Global Languages, or Architecture. Notice that unlike the others, this does not require any particular course, as long as one of these combination pairs is available, the student attends.

From the conditions, we can see that ""Planetary Sciences"" is mentioned four times, ""Mechanical Engineering"" twice, ""Global Languages"" twice, and ""Architecture"" twice, ""Mathematics"", ""Literature"", ""Supplemental Resources"" and ""Environmental Engineering"" once eche.

To satisfy as many students as possible, ""Planetary Sciences"" should definitely be included as it appears in four conditions. 

Next, if we choose a combination of ""Mechanical Engineering"" and ""Global Languages"", we cover two more conditions from Student 2 and Student 3 hence they both will attend. 

Finally, we include ""Architecture"" to satisfy Student 1 and Student 5. At this point we have used 4 of the available 5 slots.

Our last slot can be used for ""Mathematics"" which satisfies Student 1, as this student would not attend without either ""Mechanical Engineering"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Mathematics"". 

In this way we have satisfied all students except Student 4 as there is no room to add either ""Environmental Engineering""

","There are ten subjects, but the school can only offer five. Each of the five students made a condition under which they would attend the program. Our aim is to maximize the number of students.

Let's consider each one by one:

Student 1: Will attend if ""Literature and (Computer Science or Supplemental Resources)"" is offered.
Student 2: Will attend if ""Architecture and (Global Languages or Computer Science)"" is offered.
Student 3: Will attend if ""Mathematics and (Global Languages or Environmental Engineering)"" is offered.
Student 4: Will attend if ""Supplemental Resources and (Computer Science or Planetary Sciences)"" is offered.
Student 5: Will attend if ""(Supplemental Resources and Computer Science) or Mechanical Engineering"" is offered.

After looking through the list, we note that Computer Science is a common subject among several students. Let's include this in our list. Student 5 requires either two specific courses or ""Mechanical Engineering"". This does not seem feasible since other subjects can please more students, so we leave this out for now. 

As the next step, let's select ""Supplemental Resources"" as it helps to include Students 1, 4 and 5. Now, we have fulfilled two subjects requirement for Students 1 and 4, and one for Student 5.

Next, let's include ""Literature"" to complete Student 1's requirements. We have now secured Student 1 and we have 2 subjects left to offer.

To try and include students 2 and 3, we can offer ""Global Languages"", this fulfils two subject requirement for Student 2 and one for Student 3.

Finally, let's offer ""Architecture"" to complete Student 2's requirements. Now we have secured Students 1, 2, 4 attendance.

This is the best we can do. There is no way to persuade Students 3 and 5 with only one subject slot left.

","To maximize the number of students who will attend, we need to find an overlap in their course preferences, while keeping in mind that only five classes can be offered.

Student 1 necessitates Environmental Engineering. They also require either Mechanical Engineering or Supplemental Resources. 

Student 2 requires Supplemental Resources and either Planetary Sciences or Architecture.

Student 3 requires Computer Science and either Environmental Engineering or Mathematics.

Student 4 requires Architecture and either Mathematics or Literature.

Student 5 requires either Computer Science and Mathematics, or Environmental Engineering.

We can notice straight away that Environmental Engineering is a common class chosen by 3 out of 5 students. For these 3 students to attend, Environmental Engineering must be offered. 

Computer Science and Mathematics are required by 2 students, thus it would also be beneficial to offer these two classes. 

So far, we have 3 classes: Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics.

Now we need to carefully select the remaining two classes to maximize attendance:

- If Mechanical Engineering is chosen, student 1 could attend, but no other new students could be added since our classes are out. So, it would give only 1 new student.

- If Supplemental Resources is chosen, students 1 and 2 could attend, as the fifth class could be either Planetary Sciences or Architecture, both of which are required by student 2. So, this option would give 2 new students.

- If Architecture is picked, it would benefit students 2 and 4. However, since Literature, a class needed by student 4, is not one of our already picked subjects, we can't get both students. So, this option would only give 1 new student. 

Clearly, the two remaining classes should be Supplemental Resources and either Planetary Sciences or Architecture.

Considering students' preferences, the maximum number of students that will attend is 4 students: students 1, 2, 3, and 5. 

Therefore, the final list of offered classes that will maximize the attendance should be:
Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Supplemental Resources, and either Planetary Sciences or Architecture.

","To maximize the number of students attending the summer program, we have to analyze the conditions provided in their responses.

Student 1: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Mathematics and Supplemental Resources) or Literature is offered.""
- Let's denote two subjects Mathematics and Supplemental Resources as a set {Mathematics, Supplemental Resources}. Student 1 will attend if either this set or Literature is offered.

Student 2: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Supplemental Resources and Global Languages) or Mechanical Engineering is offered.""
- Similarly, denote {Supplemental Resources, Global Languages}. Student 2 will attend if either this set or Mechanical Engineering is offered.

Student 3: ""I would attend the program if and only if Environmental Engineering and (Global Languages or Mechanical Engineering) is offered.""
- Student 3 will attend if Environmental Engineering and either of Global Languages or Mechanical Engineering is offered.

Student 4: ""I would attend the program if and only if Computer Science and (Supplemental Resources or Planetary Sciences) is offered.""
- Student 4 will attend if Computer Science and either of Supplemental Resources or Planetary Sciences is offered.

Student 5: ""I would attend the program if and only if Planetary Sciences and (Architecture or Literature) is offered.""
- Student 5 will attend if Planetary Sciences and either of Architecture or Literature is offered.

Looking at the above conclusions, we can see that the ""Supplemental Resources"" subject could satisfy the conditions of Students 1, 2, and 4. So let's keep it in our selection.

Picking ""Mechanical Engineering"" will enable both Students 2 and 3 to attend. So, that's our second selection.

To satisfy Student 1's condition, we could go with ""Mathematics"".

For Student 4, we've already got ""Supplemental Resources"". Adding ""Computer Science"" would ensure this student's presence.

Lastly, looking at Student 5's condition, we can add ""Planetary Sciences"" to ensure that they will attend.

A note: In the ideal scenario, it is not possible to accommodate all five students because their preferences require more than five subjects.

So the school will have to offer: Computer Science, Planetary Sciences, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, and Supplemental Resources to get the maximum attendance - Students 1, 2, 4, and possibly 5 (only if Literature is not mandatory).

- Student 2: (""Literature"" and ""Business"") or ""Mathematics"". This indicates that either both ""Literature"" and ""Business"" or ""Mathematics"" should be offered.
- Student 3: (""Architecture"" and ""Supplemental Resources"") or ""Global Languages"". It means that either both ""Architecture"" and ""Supplemental Resources"" or ""Global Languages"" should be offered.
- Student 4: ""Global Languages"" and (""Architecture"" or ""Environmental Engineering""). This implies that ""Global Languages"" is a must and either of ""Architecture"" or ""Environmental Engineering"".
- Student 5: ""Computer Science"" and (""Literature"" or ""Environmental Engineering""). This indicates that ""Computer Science"" is a must and either of ""Literature"" or ""Environmental Engineering"".

Let's analyze the total count of the subjects:

- ""Computer Science"" : 1
- ""Business"" : 2
- ""Mathematics"" : 2
- ""Mechanical Engineering"" : 1
- ""Literature"" : 2
- ""Architecture"" : 2
- ""Global Languages"" : 2
- ""Supplemental Resources"" : 1
- ""Environmental Engineering"" : 2

We can see that ""Business"", ""Mathematics"", ""Literature"", ""Architecture"", and ""Global Languages"" have been mentioned twice by different students while the remaining subjects (""Computer Science"", ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Environmental Engineering"") are each mentioned once. 

To get the largest number of students, we need to select subjects that have been mentioned the most. Therefore, the school could offer ""Business"", ""Mathematics"", ""Literature"", ""Architecture"", and ""Global Languages"" to get the highest possible number of enrollments by satisfying the most students. This combination pleases Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4, totaling a student count of 3. Under this scenario, not all student's conditions will meet due to the limit of only 5 subjects.

","To maximize the number of students attending the program, the courses chosen should satisfy the maximum number of conditions in the students' statements. 

- Student 1 will attend only if the programs 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Computer Science' or 'Supplemental Resources' are offered.
- Student 2 will attend only if 'Literature' and 'Global Languages' or 'Planetary Sciences' are offered.
- Student 3 will attend only if 'Business' and 'Architecture' are offered, or if 'Environmental Engineering' is offered.
- Student 4 will attend only if 'Literature' and 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Computer Science' are offered.
- Student 5 will attend only if 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Computer Science' are offered or if 'Mathematics' is offered.

Looking at these statements, there's no way to satisfy all students' preferences with just 5 subjects. Let's aim to satisfy most of them.

First, let's look at the subjects that appear most frequently in the options:
- 'Computer Science' appears in the preferences of Student 1, 4 and 5.
- 'Literature' appears in the preferences of Student 2 and 4.
- 'Planetary Sciences' appears in the preferences of Student 1 and 2.
- 'Mechanical Engineering' appears in the preferences of Student 4 and 5.

We cannot satisfy the conditions of Student 3, as her choices don't coincide with any other student. 

Consider offering 'Computer Science', as it's preferred by 3 students (1,4,5). Now, if we add 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature' and 'Mechanical Engineering' to satisfy Students 1,2 and 4, we would not be able to include the 5th preferred option of Student 5 (which is 'Mathematics') as we have already chosen four courses and only one can be chosen. But if add 'Supplemental Resources' after offering the courses 'Computer Science', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Literature', we can satisfy Students 1, 2 and 5, as 'Supplemental Resources' is also preferred by Student 1. 

So, the courses chosen are: 'Computer Science', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Supplemental Resources'

With these choices, Student 1, 2 and 5 would attend the program.

","The problem can be solved by applying logical reasoning to the students' statements. First, let's break down what classes each student requires for their attendance:

- Student 1 requires Computer Science and Architecture or Environmental Engineering. 
- Student 2 requires Architecture and either Supplemental Resources or Literature. 
- Student 3 requires Global Languages and either Environmental Engineering or Computer Science. 
- Student 4 requires either Mathematics and Planetary Sciences or Architecture. 
- Student 5 requires Business and either Supplemental Resources or Literature. 

Based on the above conditions, we cannot choose a combination of subjects that will satisfy all the students due to them having diverse interests in different fields.

The main goal here is to choose such 5 subjects that as many students as possible will attend. The common course for most students is Architecture, which is required by Student 1, 2 and 4. So the school should definitely offer an Architecture class.

Now, we have 4 slots left. Student 1 requires also Computer Science, Student 3 require Global languages. By offering these two, we can have 3 students attending: Student 1, Student 3 and Student 4. 

We still have two slots available, which we can use to satisfy either the conditions of Student 2 or Student 5. We can choose to satisfy the conditions of Student 2 by offering Literature. This will mean that Student 2 will also attend the summer program because the conditions required - offering both Architecture and Literature - are now met. Finally, for the last available slot, to maximize the number of students that can attend the summer school, we should look at a course that another student would potentially be interested in. From our remaining options, Environmental Engineering seems a good fit because student 1 also shows interest, filling the last slot.

So, we have managed to arrange the summer program in such a way that 4 of the 5 students (Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4) will be attending the program.

OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Let's start by assessing the classes that students have expressed interest in:

Student 1: Included Environmental Engineering in their list. This implies that if the school offers Environmental Engineering, they are most likely to attract this student. They also mentioned Mechanical Engineering and Planetary Sciences as options, but only one needs to be chosen to ensure their attendance.

Student 2: Stated they would attend if either Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science are offered, or if Environmental Engineering is offered. Offering Environmental Engineering seems like a beneficial choice for this student as well, as it is a single class that could secure their attendance rather than needing to offer two.

Student 3: Will attend if Architecture is offered alongside either Literature or Planetary Sciences. This student may be a bit difficult to persuade due to requiring the offering of two specific courses.

Student 4: Similar to students 1 and 2, this student has also mentioned Environmental Engineering. Offering this subject would likely appeal to all three of these students. They also require either Global Languages or Literature.

Student 5: Stated they would attend if either Business and Computer Science are offered, or Supplemental Resources is offered. Offering Business and Computer Science would ensure their attendance, but this would take 2 course slots.

Looking across all student requirements, offering Environmental Engineering would attract students 1, 2 and 4. This is three out of five, which is a majority. For the remaining two course slots taking into students' preferences, offering either Literature or Planetary Sciences would cover student 3 and offering either Computer Science, Business or Supplemental Resources would cover student 5.

A balanced way to ensure the attendance of four out of five students would be to offer Environmental Engineering, Literature (or Planetary Sciences), and Computer Science (or Business or Supplemental Resources), along with two other subjects which haven’t been specifically requested by any of the students.

So the available combinations that would attract the most students (four out of five) would be:

OFFERED COURSES: ['Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business']

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Firstly, let's understand the conditions presented by each student.

Student 1 would attend the program if 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Business' are both offered, or if only 'Supplemental Resources' is offered.
Student 2 would attend the program if 'Literature' is offered and either 'Computer Science' or 'Planetary Sciences' are offered.
Student 3 would attend the program if 'Supplemental Resources' is offered and either 'Global languages' or 'Environmental Engineering'.
Student 4 would attend the program if 'Planetary Sciences' and either 'Literature' or 'Mathematics' is offered.
Student 5 would attend the program if both 'Architecture' and 'Mathematics' are offered, or if only 'Business' is offered.

In order to maximise the number of students, we will need to meet conditions that involve more shared subjects. The course 'Business' appears twice, the course 'Supplemental Resources' appears twice.

1. 'Business' could please both Student 1 (with additional course) and Student 5 (singly), and 
2. 'Supplemental Resources' could please both Student 1 (singly) and Student 3 (with additional course).

If we offer both 'Business' and 'Supplemental Resources', we still need to add another subject from Student 1's condition (Mechanical Engineering) and another subject from Student 3's condition (either Global Languages or Environmental Engineering).

Adding 'Mechanical Engineering' to meet Student 1's condition and 'Global Languages' to meet Student 3's condition, we have now 4 courses covering 3 students.

For the fifth course, it's worthwhile to note that the remaining condition from Student 2 or Student 4 both requires 'Literature'. Offering 'Literature' will thereby attract one additional student - either Student 2 or Student 4.

All the five subjects that need to be offered, 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', and 'Literature', will attract four out of five students. Any other combination wouldn't have attracted equally or more students.

","Looking at the students' conditions, Mathematics and Environmental Engineering seem to appear frequently. Hence, it would be ideal to offer these two among the five courses to attract more students.

Next, let us see the conditions that can be satisfied by choosing remaining three subjects.

- If we pick 'Literature' and two other random subjects not related to the other conditions, we could satisfy Student 1 and Student 5. That makes 2 students.
- If we pick 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Computer Science', we could satisfy Student 4. That makes only 1 student which is less than the previous case.
- If we pick 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Architecture', we could satisfy Student 2. That's only 1 student again, less than the first case.
- If we pick 'Computer Science' and 'Business', we could satisfy Student 3. That's too only 1 student, less than the first case.

It's clear from above that we should pick 'Literature' and then two non-conflicting subjects. Let's pick 'Computer Science' and 'Business', because these are more popular subjects.

Following this approach, we can meet the preferences of Student 1 and Student 5 – maximizing the number of satisfied students.

Unfortunately, we are unable to satisfy more than two students given the constraints.

","This problem involves both logical reasoning and condition satisfaction. We have to choose five subjects which satisfies maximum students' condition. Therefore, we have to start by breaking down the conditions given by the students.

1. Student 1: ""Supplemental Resources and (Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering)""
   - It means that student 1 needs both the subject ""Supplemental Resources"" and either one of ""Mathematics"" or ""Mechanical Engineering"".

2. Student 2: ""Architecture and (Literature or Environmental Engineering)""
   - Student 2 needs ""Architecture"" and either of ""Literature"" or ""Environmental Engineering"".

3. Student 3: ""(Computer Science and Supplemental Resources) or Architecture""
   - Student 3 needs both ""Computer Science"" and ""Supplemental Resources"", or just ""Architecture"".

4. Student 4: ""Global Languages and (Supplemental Resources or Architecture)""
   - Convert this to: ""Global Languages"" and either ""Supplemental Resources"" or ""Architecture"".

5. Student 5: ""Architecture and (Computer Science or Business)""
   - This translates to ""Architecture"" and either ""Computer Science"" or ""Business"".

Looking at all the conditions, we can identify some common subjects. The course ""Architecture"" appears in all the conditions except for Student 1, and ""Supplemental Resources"" is mentioned by Student 1, 3 and 4. Include these two courses because they fulfil the constraints of maximum students.

For Student 1, we can choose ""Mathematics"" which is also likely to attract other students who have not mentioned their preferences. That's three courses. 

For Student 3, we can pick ""Computer Science"" to satisfy his/her complete demand, as we have already picked ""Supplemental Resources"". 

Lastly, we should pick ""Global Languages"" to satisfy the condition of Student 4 because all of his/her other conditions are already satisfied by our existing course shirtlists.

So, this combination will satisfy Student 1, 2 (partially), Student 3, Student 4 and Student 5 (partially). It's not possible to fulfill any more constraints while adhering to the limit of selecting five subjects only.

OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","The goal is to find a group of five subjects that would attract as many students as possible. Let's analyze student by student:

Student 1 will attend the program if and only if Environmental Engineering and (Mathematics or Business) is offered. This requires 'Environmental Engineering', and either 'Mathematics' or 'Business'.

Student 2 will attend the program if and only if Mechanical Engineering and (Supplemental Resources or Literature) is offered. This requires 'Mechanical Engineering', and either 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Literature'.

Student 3 will attend the program if and only if (Architecture and Mathematics) or Planetary Sciences is offered. This requires either 'Architecture' and 'Mathematics', or 'Planetary Sciences'.

Student 4 will attend the program if and only if (Literature and Mathematics) or Business is offered. This requires either 'Literature' and 'Mathematics', or 'Business'.

Student 5 will attend the program if and only if Supplemental Resources and (Planetary Sciences or Computer Science) is offered. This requires 'Supplemental Resources', and either 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Computer Science'.

To maximize the number of attending students, we can account for common course requirements between the students. We can see that 'Mathematics' is a common requirement among the students. Therefore, 'Mathematics' must be one of the offered classes. 

After 'Mathematics', we see 'Business' can be chosen to support Student 1 and Student 4, 'Literature' can be chosen to satisfy Student 2, and 'Supplemental Resources' can be chosen to satisfy Student 5. 

At this point, we have chosen 4 subjects. For the last one, 'Mechanical Engineering' can be chosen to satisfy the 2nd student and 'Environmental Engineering' can be chosen to satisfy the 1st student. 

Choosing either of these will lead to the same amount of students attending because neither is common among any other students. So I'll go with 'Mechanical Engineering' as the last subject.


OFFERED COURSES: ['Mathematics', 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering']

The students that will attend are Student 1, Student 2, Student 4, and Student 5. This results in 4 out of 5 students attending, which is the maximum we can get based on the students' requirements.",,0.34980237154150196

","Let's analyze what conditions need to be met for each student to attend:

1. Student 1 will attend if Supplemental Resources AND (Environmental Engineering OR Literature) are offered.
2. Student 2 will attend if (Literature AND Supplemental Resources) OR Business are offered.
3. Student 3 will attend if (Business AND Environmental Engineering) OR Mechanical Engineering is offered.
4. Student 4 will attend if Literature AND (Computer Science OR Mechanical Engineering) are offered.
5. Student 5 will attend if (Mathematics AND Architecture) OR Mechanical Engineering is offered.

Now let's start by thinking of an efficient way of making the maximum number of students attend. Let's aim at getting at least four out of five to attend:

From the above five statements it looks like Supplemental Resources, Literature and Mechanical Engineering have been mentioned by more than one student. So let's start by considering these three. Now we have room for only two more subjects.

1. If we choose Environmental Engineering, we can satisfy Student 1.
2. If we choose Business, we can satisfy Student 2 and possibly Student 3 (if Environmental Engineering is not selected).
3. If we choose Computer Science, we can satisfy Student 4 (if Literature is selected - which is the case here).

Given the constraints - we want to make sure that we can make the most number of students attend and keeping in mind we can select only two out of the three between Environmental Engineering, Business and Computer Science - the optimal strategy would be to select Business and Computer Science. 

So, in conclusion, the following five subjects will allow a maximum of four students to attend:

1. Supplemental Resources,
2. Literature,
3. Mechanical Engineering,
4. Business,
5. Computer Science.

Unfortunately, due to the constraints that a maximum of only 5 subjects can be offered and the preconditions that are required by each student, it is impossible to have all five students attend the summer program given the above conditions.

Student 1, Student 2 and Student 4 will attend because their conditions will be fully met, while Student 3 will attend because one part of his condition (Mechanical Engineering) will be met.

Given this explanation, the five classes to offer are:

For example, the last line might look like this:

","Let's break down this decision by looking at the preferences of the students.

Student 1 needs Supplemental Resources, and Business or Global Languages. So this student would require at least 2 classes, possibly 3.

Student 2 needs Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering or Literature. This student also potentially requires 3 classes.

Student 3 needs Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics or Business. This student would need 2-3 classes.

Student 4 might only need 1 class (Computer Science), or he might need 2 (Supplemental Resources and Mechanical Engineering). 

Student 5 might only need 1 class (Mathematics), or he might need 2 (Computer Science and Business).

From these preferences, we can see that Computer Science is a popular choice. Let's start by choosing that class. This would satisfy part of the requirements for Student 2, 4, and 5. 

Next, let's choose Business. This satisfies some requirements for Student 1, 3, and 5.

Let's choose Mechanical Engineering next, which can help fulfill the requirements for Student 2, 3, and 4. 

With those three classes, we've satisfied at least part of the requirements of all students. Now let's select between Supplemental Resources and Mathematics. If we choose Supplemental Resources, we satisfy the rest of Student 1 and 4's requirements. If we choose Mathematics, we complete Student 3 and 5's requirements. In both cases, we get 2 out of the remaining 3 students.

Given this information, let's choose Supplemental Resources, since this course has not been mentioned in the previous selections. 

For the last class, none of the remaining programs can attract more than one additional person. We can use the freedom of choice here, and select Literature for the fifth class to complete the remaining requirement for Student 2. 

This way, the maximum number of students attending the Summer program can be four, namely: Student 1, 2, 4, 5.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","Step 1: Look at the subjects preferred by each student.

Looking at the statements, 'Planetary Sciences' seems to be a common major interest. 3 students (Student 1, 2 and 3) would attend classes if 'Planetary Sciences' is offered. Additionally, 'Planetary Sciences' broadens the attendance to students 2 and 4 if 'Supplemental Resources' is offered and to student 1 if 'Literature' is offered.

Step 2: Identifying the best combination.

This means that, if we offer 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature' as three of the courses, we can max out the attendance to 4 students (student 1, 2, 4 and 5). Here, keep in mind that the school can offer only 2 more courses. 

Step 3: Increasing the attendance.

Since 'Global Languages' seems to be a common interest of students 1 and 3, and 'Mechanical Engineering' seems to be of interest to student 2, we will offer these two courses as the remaining options.

Step 4: Summary of why the choice is optimal.

Planetary Sciences, Supplemental Resources, and Literature already ensures the attendance of 4 students. We then added Global Languages for student 1 and Mechanical Engineering for student 2. This brings us to our capacity of 5 courses, and we can't offer more subjects to accommodate more students. This combination will ensure the maximum attendance, as 5 out of 5 students would join the classes.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Looking at the students’ statements, we can break this down into two priorities:
- Prioritize subjects that are mentioned multiple times so they have a better chance of satisfying more students. 
- Prioritize subjects that are in ""and"" statements over ""or"" statements, because the and statement would be worthless to a student if both subjects aren't offered.

Based on these conditions, the following subjects get repeated mentions: 
- Business: 3 times 
- Literature: 2 times
- Supplemental Resources: 3 times
- Planetary Sciences: 3 times 
- Mathematics: 2 times 
- Global Languages: 2 times

Considering these repeats and the AND statements from the students, the 5 subjects the school should offer are ""Business"", ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Mathematics"", and ""Global Languages"". 

Here's why: 
- Student 1 will attend. We offer Business and Global Languages meet the condition of Business and Literature or Global Languages.
- Student 2 will not attend. We lack Literature for Supplemental Resources and Literature or Planetary Sciences.
- Student 3 will attend. We offer Supplemental Resources to meet the condition of Planetary Sciences & Business or Supplemental Resources.
- Student 4 will not attend. Even though we offer Planetary Sciences and Business, we lack Mathematics for Planetary Sciences and Mathematics or Business.
- Student 5 will attend. We offer Mathematics and Global Languages, meeting the condition of Mathematics and Global Languages or Supplemental Resources.

So based on this choice, 3 out of 5 students would attend. We can't modify the choice to make the 4th student attend as the key subjects Literature and Mathematics are both requested by two students with different preferences hence can't find a set of subjects to satisfy all 5 students.

","The aim is to find a combination of courses that meet the preferences of as many students as possible, given the limitation of offering only 5 subjects. Let's analyze each student's preferences:

1. Student 1: Business and (Environmental Engineering or Global Languages)
2. Student 2: (Global Languages and Literature) or Environmental Engineering
3. Student 3: Literature and (Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science)
4. Student 4: (Literature and Computer Science) or Mathematics
5. Student 5: (Business and Environmental Engineering) or Supplemental Resources

From these preferences, we can see that ""Business"", ""Literature"" and ""Environmental Engineering"" are the courses that appear most frequently. By guaranteeing these courses, we could potentially make three students attend the program: Student 1, 2, and 5.

However, we still have 2 other courses to offer. For these remaining 2 spots, we should select the courses that can meet the requirements of Student 2, 3, and 4 so as to maximize student attendance.

Student 2 would attend if 'Global Languages' is offered. Neither Student 3 nor 4 has 'Global Languages' in their preferences. Therefore, offering 'Global Languages' would only benefit Student 2.

Student 3 would attend if either 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Computer Science' is offered. Student 4 also has 'Computer Science' in their preferences. Offering 'Mechanical Engineering' would only benefit Student 3, but offering 'Computer Science' would benefit both Students 3 and 4.

Therefore, to maximize student attendance, the five courses that should be offered are: 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Global Languages' and 'Computer Science'. This arrangement enables four students (1, 3, 4, 5) to attend.

","Step 1: Based on the conditions of the students' statements, we note that ""Supplemental Resources"" is a common subject of interest for Student 1, Student 2, and Student 4. Thus, it should definitely be included in the offered courses.

Step 2: For the remaining options in their conditions, we observe that Student 1 would attend if ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Business"" is offered, and Student 4 would attend if ""Business"" and ""Computer Science"" are offered. Hence, ""Business"" may be a good pick as it would, in combination with ""Supplemental Resources"", convince both Student 1 and Student 4 to attend.

Step 3: If we also offer ""Computer Science"", as per Step 2, we may be able to add Student 4 to the attendance list, assuming that they prioritize ""Supplemental Resources"" even if the entire clause ""(Business and Computer Science) or Supplemental Resources"" isn't fulfilled. 

Step 4: Looking further, Student 3 would attend if ""(Architecture and Supplemental Resources) or Environmental Engineering"" is offered. By choosing ""Architecture"" and ""Environmental Engineering"", we make sure that Student 3's condition is fulfilled.

Step 5: Student 5's condition ""(Architecture and (Computer Science or Business))"" is already fulfilled as we are offering ""Architecture"" and ""Business"".

Due to the limitations from the school (can only offer exactly 5 subjects), and from the logical implications of the students' statements, we can't convince student 2 to attend, as we would need to drop one of the five courses selected in the previous steps.

Hence, to attract as many students as possible, the school should offer these subjects:

Student 2: Architecture, Environmental Engineering or Global Languages
Student 3: Global Languages and (Supplemental Resources or Architecture)
Student 4: Supplemental Resources and (Mathematics or Global Languages)
Student 5: Business and Global Languages or Literature

From these, we can identify the most requested subjects:
1. Global Languages, offered to satisfy Student 2, 3, 4 and 5.
2. Business, offered to satisfy Student 1, and 5.
3. Supplemental Resources, offered to satisfy Student 3 and 4.
4. Mathematics, offered to satisfy Student 1 and 4.
5. Either Computer Science, Architecture, or Literature. We can choose any of these as they all satisfy 1 more student (and only one).

We must make a choice based on availability or other factors since Student 1 and 2 can already be satisfied. If we choose Computer Science, Student 1 will attend; if we choose Literature, Student 5 will attend; if we choose Architecture, we can’t get any of the remaining Student 2 or 5.

So, we can choose either Literature or Computer Science for the fifth subject for a total of three students. Choosing Architecture as a fifth subject will only get 2 students. 
Therefore, any of these three combinations will result in maximum students attending:

1. Global Languages, Business, Supplemental Resources, Mathematics, Computer Science.
This give us maximum Students: Student 1, 3, 4.

2. Global Languages, Business, Supplemental Resources, Mathematics, Literature.
This give us maximum Students: Student 3, 4, 5.

Given no other information, we can choose either subject list.

","To maximize the number of students attending the program, let's analyze the input from the students and see if we can identify an optimal combination of courses. 

- 'Business' and 'Literature' seem to be popular subjects, because they are mentioned by multiple students (Student 1, Student 2 and Student 4 for 'Business'; Student 1 and Student 5 for 'Literature'). 

- Considering the popularity of 'Business' and 'Literature', it would be a good idea to offer these two subjects. Therefore, 'Business' and 'Literature' are in our potential course list. 

- Now we have three slots left to decide. Looking closer, we see that 'Supplemental Resources' could accomodate Student 1 and Student 5 together if offered. Hence, 'Supplemental Resources' becomes our third course. 

- Now,'Global Languages' can cover student 4 and student 5 if it is offered along with the above-mentioned subjects. Hence, 'Global Languages' becomes our fourth course.

- For the last course, 'Mechanical Engineering' is a common preference among Student 3 and Student 4. Hence, 'Mechanical Engineering' becomes our final and fifth course.

To sum up, by offering 'Business', 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Global Languages' and 'Mechanical Engineering', the school would have the maximum number of students - Student 1, Student 4 and Student 5 attending the Summer Program. Unfortunately, it's not possible to accommodate Student 2 or Student 3, as we've already reached the limit of five courses, and their pre-requisites are mutually exclusive with ""Architecture"" and ""Environmental Engineering"" respectively.

","The goal is to find a combination of 5 subjects that will accommodate as many student preferences as possible.

To maximize the number of students attending, it makes sense to look for commonly requested subjects across students.

Looking at the subjects each student needs to join, we can see that ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Computer Science"" and ""Architecture"" are demanded by several students.

Student 1 needs both ""Architecture"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" or just ""Computer Science"".

Student 3 needs ""Planetary Sciences"" and either ""Computer Science"" or ""Mechanical Engineering""

Student 4 needs ""Planetary Sciences"" and either ""Architecture"" or ""Supplemental Resources""

If we choose ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Computer Science"" and ""Architecture"" as three of our subjects, this way we fulfill the requirements of Student 1, Student 3 and Student 4.

Student 5 needs both ""Architecture and Mathematics"" or just ""Computer Science"".

""Computer science"" we have already picked hence Student 5 will also join the program. 

This leaves us with two more subjects to select. Here we can choose any two subjects, because remaining student Student 2 requires a combination of subjects which we already can't provide as we've already chosen 3 out of the 5 subjects we can offer.

To sum up, if we provide courses in ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Computer Science"", ""Architecture"", then students 1, 3, 4 and 5, which are a total of 4 out of 5 students, will join the program.
We can add any other two courses to reach the maximum of 5 that we can offer, because it's impossible to accommodate the preferences of student 2 at this point.

","The first step would be to assess the conditions each student has for attending the program:

Student 1 needs both Business and either Mathematics or Architecture.
Student 2 needs both Environmental Engineering and either Architecture or Literature.
Student 3 needs either both Environmental Engineering and Mathematics, or Architecture.
Student 4 needs either both Mathematics and Computer Science, or Mechanical Engineering.
Student 5 needs both Computer Science and either Supplemental Resources or Business.

The second step is to see if any combination of five subjects can meet more than three students' conditions. Comparing the lists, there is one subject - Architecture - that appears in three students' lists. However, it quickly becomes clear that even offering Architecture, no combination of other subjects can satisfy three students' full conditions.

The final step is to find a combination that satisfies two students' conditions. The common subjects between students are 
Business and Computer Science (Student 1 and Student 5), Mathematics and Architecture (Student 1 and Student 3), Environmental Engineering and Mathematics (Student 2 and Student 3), and Mathematics and Computer Science (Student 3 and Student 4). Each combination requires additional subjects to meet the conditions, and we can only choose five subjects in total.

Considering all these constraints, one possible solution is to satisfy the conditions for Students 1 and 5 because they both have Business and Computer Science in their conditions. The five subjects then can include Business, Computer Science, Mathematics or Architecture (to fulfill Student 1's condition), and Supplemental Resources (to fulfill Student 5's condition). The fifth subject could be any.

So, the best solution under the given constraints is to meet the conditions of Student 1 and Student 5. No other combination can result in more students attending.

","From the students' preferences we understand that:

Students 1, 2, and 4 need 'Literature' to be offered.
Student 1 will need either 'Business' or 'Supplemental Resources' along with 'Literature' to attend.
Student 2 will be fine if 'Literature' and 'Supplemental Resources' are offered without 'Business'.
Student 4 will need 'Computer Science', along with 'Literature'.
Student 5 needs 'Architecture' or 'Global Languages' along with 'Computer Science' to attend.
Student 3 is an outlier with preferences that do not align with most students and hence including their preferences will lead to losing more students.

By considering the preferences of students 1, 2, 4, and 5, the best combination is to offer 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Business', and one of 'Global Languages' or 'Architecture' as Student 5 is fine with either. Choosing any other combination would result in less than 4 students attending.

For the purpose of choosing 5 courses, let's offer 'Global Languages' over 'Architecture'. This will ensure student 1, 2, 4 and 5 will attend. 

Even though we would like all students to attend, it is not possible to accommodate all student preferences due to the constraints of offering only 5 subjects and the varied preferences of the students.

","Firstly, let's analyze each student's statements to determine the courses they're interested in.

In all the statements, each student would be satisfied with one pair of subjects, or a single one:

1. Student 1: Environmental Engineering and Planetary Sciences or Business
2. Student 2: Literature and Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering 
3. Student 3: Supplemental Resources and Environmental Engineering or Literature 
4. Student 4: Architecture and Literature or Architecture and Computer Science
5. Student 5: Computer Science and Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering 

Considering the need to satisfy as many students as possible, it seems feasible to aim for satisfying 4 students out of 5, because to satisfy any student requires at least 2 courses, and 5*2=10 > number of total classes that can be offered. 

Now let's consider the shared classes among the students.

1. Environmental Engineering is shared by Student 1 and Student 3.
2. Literature is shared by Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4.
3. Mechanical Engineering is shared by Student 2 and Student 5.
4. Computer Science is shared by Student 4 and Student 5.
5. Business, Mathematics, Architecture, Supplemental Resources, and Planetary Sciences are unique to their respective students.

Based on this analysis, it looks like a viable strategy would be to offer Literature and Computer Science, satisfying Student 4. Literature and Environmental Engineering, satisfying Student 3. Literature and Mathematics, satisfying Student 2 and Environmental Engineering and Planetary Sciences, satisfying Student 1.

This would satisfy 4 out of 5 students.

It appears that no matter how we juggle the classes, adding any of the unique courses would only satisfy an additional 1 student, hence affording no better turnout than this strategy.

","First, let's breakdown the statements of each student:

Student 1 involves 3 classes: Supplemental Resources, Global Languages, Environmental Engineering
Student 2 involves 3 classes: Planetary Sciences, Supplemental Resources, Architecture
Student 3 involves 3 classes: Architecture, Business, Literature
Student 4 involves 3 classes: Architecture, Supplemental Resources, Literature
Student 5 involves 3 classes: Global Languages, Planetary Sciences, Supplemental Resources

The school has to offer exactly 5 classes. The course that appears most frequently across all students is ""Supplemental Resources"" which happens to appear 4 times. Secondly, ""Architecture"" appears thrice, ""Literature"" appears twice, ""Planetary Sciences"" and ""Global Languages"" both appear twice. To satisfy all students, ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Business"" cannot be included based on the constraint that only five classes can be offered.

If the school offers ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Architecture"", ""Literature"", ""Planetary Sciences"", and ""Global Languages"", the conditions for Student 1, Student 2, Student 4, and Student 5 will be met. 

However, the conditions for Student 3 won't be met as ""Business"" won't be offered. 

In this case, four students will attend which is the maximum number possible given the constraints that exactly 5 classes can be offered.

Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:

","To begin the task, let's analyze the students' preferences - 

Student 1 will attend if (Architecture & Supplemental Resources) OR Global Languages is offered.

Student 2 will attend if (Literature AND either Computer Science or Global Languages) is offered.

Student 3 will attend if (Literature AND Environmental Engineering) OR Supplemental Resources is offered.

Student 4 will attend if (Business and Architecture) OR Literature.

Student 5 will attend if Planetary Sciences is offered along with either (Computer Science or Environmental Engineering).

If we scrutinize all the preferences, 'Literature' seems like a good choice to include because it is mentioned by 3 out of the 5 students (Students 2, 3, and 4).

By choosing Literature, we meet the requirements of Students 2 and 4 partially. Student 3's requirements can also potentially be met, if we choose 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Environmental Engineering'.

If we go with 'Supplemental Resources', this will fully satisfy Student 1's second condition as well as partially know off Student 3's first OR statement or Student 1's first requirement.

To satisfy Student 2's second condition, we can pick 'Computer Science,' which also contributes toward Student 5's conditions.

To decide the fourth subject, we can choose 'Architecture'. With this, we can cater to Student 1 fully (by satisfying his/her first requirement), and also partially fulfill Student 4's condition.

Lastly, to get Student 2 on board completely, we need to include 'Business'. This will also satisfy Student 4's whole condition.

So, to sum it up - 
Literature meets conditions for Students - 2 (Partial), 3 (Partial), 4 (Partial)
Supplemental Resources would satisfy Students - 1 (Full if no Architecture), 3 (Partial), 1 (Partial if Architecture)
Computer Science is needed by Students - 2 (Partial) and 5 (Partial)
Architecture will potentially attract Students - 1 (Full if no Supplemental Resources) and 4 (Partial) 
Business satisfies conditions for Students - 2 (Full) and 4 (Full)

Therefore, the best 5 subjects to offer to get maximum student participation would be 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', 'Business'.

","Firstly, we need to note that we can only select a maximum of 5 subjects, as stated in the problem. Therefore, going with the premise of trying to please as many students as possible, we need to see if there are any courses that are mentioned more than once by the students.

1. Literature is mentioned by 3 students (student 1, student 2 and student 4).
2. Mechanical Engineering is mentioned by 3 students (student 1, student 3 and student 5).
3. Supplemental Resources are mentioned by 2 students (student 2 and student 5).
4. Business is mentioned by student 2.
5. Architecture is mentioned by student 1.
6. Environmental engineering is mentioned by student 3.
7. Mathematics is mentioned by 2 students (student 3 and student 5).
8. Planetary Sciences is mentioned by student 4.
9. Computer Science is mentioned by student 4.

Literature and Mechanical Engineering are popular among the students. However, we need to remember that some students have complex requirements. For example, student 2 will only attend if Business and either Literature or Supplemental Resources are offered. This means that even if Literature is offered, student 2 will not attend if Business is not also offered. 

Considering these details, I selected the five courses that will maximize the number of students attending the summer program. These are:

1. Literature - chosen for students 1,2,4
2. Mechanical Engineering - chosen for students 1,3,5
3. Business - chosen for student 2
4. Supplemental Resources - chosen for student 5
5. Mathematics - chosen for student 5 (it makes student 3’s attendance possible but because Environmental engineering cannot be offered due to the limit of five courses, student 3 won’t be able to attend even though one of their choices is offered)

With these selections, students 1,2,4 and 5 will attend the program. We cannot make all 5 students attend because of the constraints of only being able to offer 5 subjects.

","First, we note that none of the student's conditions rely on 'Mathematics'. Thus, we can infer that 'Mathematics' will not be included in our group of five courses.

Also, we observe that 'Mechanical Engineering' is common among Students 1, 3, and 4, and at least two students have 'Global Languages', 'Literature', and 'Computer Science' included in their conditions. 

Now let's think about how we can maximize the number of students who will attend.

- If we offer 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', 'Literature', and 'Computer Science', this covers the conditions for Students 1, 2, and 4. 

- We then need a fifth course. If we add 'Supplemental Resources', this would bring Student 3 in, as they will attend if either 'Supplemental Resources' is offered or if both 'Global Languages' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered. 

With these five courses – 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', and 'Supplemental Resources' – Students 1, 2, 3, and 4 would attend the program. 

Unfortunately, we can't make Student 5 attend the program because the remaining course – 'Architecture' – isn't being offered.

","The first step is to understand the demands of each student, and then try to fit them inside the constraint of five courses:

Student 1: Mathematics and (Supplemental Resources or Architecture)
Student 2: (Mechanical Engineering and Environmental Engineering) or Supplemental Resources
Student 3: (Architecture and Computer Science) or Mechanical Engineering
Student 4: (Supplemental Resources and Literature) or Mathematics
Student 5: (Architecture and Business) or Global Languages

In order to maximize the number of students that attend, it stands to reason that we should prioritize courses that are most frequently requested. By inspecting the statements above, it is clear that the course 'Supplemental Resources' is the most commonly requested course, mentioned by student 1, 2 and 4.

Thus, 'Supplemental Resources' should be one of the classes offered. Including this class, it fulfills conditions for student 1, 2 and 4 on the basis of only one course. 

The course 'Mathematics' is required by student 1 and 4, so it could be reasonable to include this one as well. Furthermore, it needs noted that it is impossible to satisfy both student 2 and 3 with the remaining three courses because they both require two specific courses. 

So the idea is to include either 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Environmental Engineering' (to satisfy student 2) or 'Architecture' and 'Computer Science' (to satisfy student 3).

However, 'Architecture' is requested by student 3 and 5, therefore including 'Architecture' will make atleast one more student attend which is better off than choosing 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Environmental Engineering'. 

'Literature' is needed by only student 4, including 'Literature' could make one more student attend the classes. 

Finally, with only one remaining slot, we can still make one more student happy. Neither of the remaining subjects 'Business' is required by student 5. 

Finally we have: 'Mathematics', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Literature', 'Business' we ensure that all 5 can join.

","First, let's make a note of what courses each student wants. 

- Student 1 wants Literature, Global Languages, Planetary Sciences
- Student 2 wants Planetary Sciences, Global Languages, Architecture 
- Student 3 wants Global Languages, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science 
- Student 4 wants Mathematics, Planetary Sciences, Computer Science
- Student 5 wants Environmental Engineering, Mathematics, Planetary Sciences

On initial observation, it is clear that the subject ""Planetary Sciences"" is a common choice among students. So, the school should definitely offer this. 

The next common choice is ""Global Languages."" However, offering this alone is not enough to encourage more students to attend. It must be offered with either Literature, Planetary Sciences, or Mechanical Engineering. As we're already offering Planetary Sciences, we know that offering Global Languages as well will encourage two students to attend (Student 1 and Student 2), which seems to be the maximum we can get from two subjects.

Now, we have already selected two subjects: 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Global Languages'.

Next, we observe that 'Computer Science' is a common choice among two students (Student 3 and Student 4) and does not require an additional subject to be chosen. So, let's add that to the list. 

Now, we have already selected three subjects: 'Planetary Sciences', 'Global Languages' and 'Computer Science'. This will make Students 2, 3 and 4 attend the programs.

For the fourth choice, if we go with 'Architecture', it doesn't attract any new students as Student 2 is already included by the selection of 'Global Languages' and 'Planetary Sciences'. Alternatively, if we choose 'Mathematics', we make the program attractive for Student 5 when combined with 'Planetary Sciences' that we're already offering.

Now, we have 'Planetary Sciences', 'Global Languages', 'Computer Science' and 'Mathematics' as the four selected subjects. This makes students 2, 3, 4 and 5 attend the program.

For the final choice, we have one subject left. Although we could choose 'Literature' to attract Student 1, this won't increase the overall number of students who attend because Student 1 is already included by the selection of 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Global Languages'. Therefore, instead of 'Literature', we will go with 'Environmental Engineering' to increase the diversity of subjects.

So the last list of subjects will be 'Planetary Sciences', 'Global Languages', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics' and 'Environmental Engineering'.

","The school wants to provide a summer program that will attract as many of the 5 students as possible. The challenge here is that each student's preference consists of 2 to 3 classes, and the school can only offer 5 in total. We need to find the best combination of classes which covers most student's requirement.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. Begin by identifying which subjects are most in demand among the students. These are:
- Computer Science : 2 mentions (by Student 2 and 3)
- Supplemental Resources : 3 mentions (by Student 1, 2 and 3)
- Architecture : 3 mentions (by Student 1, 3 and 4)
- Global Languages : 1 mention (by Student 2)
- Planetary Sciences : 1 mention (by Student 1)
- Mechanical Engineering : 2 mentions (by Student 4 and 5)
- Literature : 1 mention (by Student 4)
- Business : 1 mention (by Student 5)
- Environmental Engineering : 1 mention (by Student 5)

2. At the first glance, 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Architecture' are clearly in demand as they are mentioned by 3 students. So these 2 subjects are mandatory to attract maximum attendance.

3. For the remaining 3 choices, the school would want to satisfy the maximum number of students, but the combinations Student 1, 2, 3, and 4 have one common subject (either 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Architecture') but each of them have a second subject in the condition that is unique. Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy all four students.

4. Since 'Computer Science' is preferred by 2 students (Student 2 and 3) and 'Mechanical Engineering' is preferred by 2 (Student 4 and 5), add these to the courses offered list.

5. We're left with 1 more class and the best we can do is satisfy one more student. There isn't any remaining subject that appears in the requirements of multiple students, so just pick one. 'Planetary Sciences' is chosen so that Student 1's condition is fulfilled, and they will attend the program.

This allows a maximum of three students to attend: Student 1 ('Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Architecture'), Student 3 ('Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science' or 'Architecture'), and Student 4 ('Architecture' and 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Literature').

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","To begin, let's list down the conditions that each student requested:

1. Student 1 would attend if Mathematics AND (Supplemental Resources OR Literature) are offered.
2. Student 2 would attend if (Mathematics AND Environmental Engineering) OR Literature is offered.
3. Student 3 would attend if Computer Science AND (Global Languages OR Supplemental Resources) are offered.
4. Student 4 would attend if Business AND (Mechanical Engineering OR Literature) are offered.
5. Student 5 would attend if (Mathematics AND Business) OR Supplemental Resources is offered.

The school can only offer 5 subjects, hence we need to find a combination of subjects that will accommodate the most students. 

To achieve maximum attendance let's look for overlapping subject choices. We can notice that:

- Mathematics is mentioned by Students 1, 2, and 5.
- Literature is mentioned by Students 1, 2, and 4.
- Supplemental Resources is mentioned by Students 1, 3, and 5.
- Business is mentioned by Students 4, and 5.

Based on the above, we can see that Mathematics, Supplemental Resources, and Literature would attract three students each, which is the most, we can get out of a single subject. By choosing these three, we are able to satisfy the requirements for Students 1, 2, and 5. Additionally, we have also partially satisfied the requirements for Student 4.

For our remaining two subjects, we can pick subjects that would fully include another student's preference. We can pick Computer Science and Global Languages from Student 3's preference or Business and Mechanical Engineering from Student 4’s preference.

If we choose subjects from Student 3's preference, we end up with four students attending as Student 3 now has his/her requirements fulfilled too.

If we choose Business and Mechanical Engineering, then Student 4 would attend. We would end up with 4 students attending but since Student 5 has a second option which is Supplemental Resources and we already included that in our selection, we can give preference to Student 4 and choose Business and Mechanical Engineering as our remaining subjects.

So, we would end up with 4 students attending the Summer program. The students who are attending would be Student 1, 2, 4, and 5. It is not possible to make more students attend because of the specific requirements provided by each student that do not overlap sufficiently.

Since the school can only offer five classes, strategy needs to be taken into account to attract as many students as possible.

If we select 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', and 'Mechanical Engineering', we will have Students 1, 2, 3, and 5. 

But if we replace 'Mechanical Engineering' with 'Mathematics', we can attract the same amount of students (Students 1, 2, 3, and 5).

Other combinations attract fewer students:

- 'Literature', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering': includes Students 3 and 4.
- 'Literature', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering': includes Students 1, 4, and 5.
- 'Literature', 'Business', 'Computer Science', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering': includes Students 2 and 3.
- 'Literature', 'Business', 'Computer Science', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources': includes Students 1 and 3.

Considering the information available, 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', and 'Mathematics' are the best choices, because they attract four out of five students, which is the maximum number possible considering the constraints.

","Looking at the students' conditions, here's a breakdown:

Student 1 and 4 have similar conditions and are willing to take the Summer program if Supplemental Resources is offered. 

Student 2 also will attend if Supplemental Resources is offered.

So, having 'Supplemental Resources' makes it possible to get 3 students.

Students 3 and 5 both need 'Architecture' to join, thus 'Architecture' should be in the list.

This way we have 2 courses and can fill in the remaining 3 slots.

Student 5 would also attend if 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Mathematics' is offered. So let's choose 'Mechanical Engineering' as it also suits the second student.

We now have 3 courses and need to fill in 2 more. To get student 5, we still need 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Mathematics'. We choose 'Mechanical Engineering' because student 5's condition will be satisfied. However, student 2 conditions will now also be satisfied.

Now we need to choose one more course to satisfy conditions of 4th student as all other student's conditions have been satisfied. To do this, we can choose 'Planetary Sciences'.

The last course to be included can be any course since condition of every student has been satisfied. Let's choose 'Mathematics' to provide a diverse blend of courses.

Note: While student 1 requirement 'Computer Science' and 'Literature' or 'Supplemental Resources' will be fulfilled, the conditions of student 4 will not be met. This is because we can only have 5 courses and prioritizing 'Supplemental Resources' offered 3 students to attend the class. Therefore, we have optimized the courses for the maximum students which are 4 out of 5.

","The only way to have all students attend the program is if all their preferred subjects are offered. But since the school can only offer 5 subjects, we'll have to make some compromises. 

1. The first obvious common subject that majority of the students want is 'Mechanical Engineering'. So, this will be the first subject on our list.

2. 'Mechanical Engineering' pairs with other three different subjects according to the students' preferences: 'Business', 'Environment Engineering' / 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Architecture' / 'Global Languages'. 

3. Looking at the requirements of the other students, 'Supplemental Resources' also pairs with 'Planetary Sciences' for student 4, and 'Environmental Engineering' pairs with no other subject for any other student. Hence, we take 'Supplemental Resources' as the second subject.

4. Next, 'Business' is paired with 'Computer Science', which no other student pairs with any other subject, and 'Architecture' is paired with nothing else, so we pick 'Business' and 'Architecture' as our third and forth courses.

5. By step 4 we have accommodated Students 1, 2, 4 and partially 5. For our final course, none of the remaining courses ('Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences') will fully satisfy any other student. Therefore, we can choose any one of them. Let's choose 'Computer Science' to partially satisfy Student 5. 

By this combination, we have 1, 2, 4 students who will definitely attend and Student 5 who may consider attending.

","To maximize the number of students attending the summer program, we have to analyze each student's condition for attending. We have only 5 subjects slots available and we want to attract as many students as possible. We prioritize subjects that attract multiple students and try to find a common combination that satisfies most students.

1) Student 1: Demands 'Computer Science' and one of either 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Architecture'.
2) Student 2: Demands 'Business' and one of either 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Literature'.
3) Student 3: Demands 'Global Languages' and one of either 'Business' or 'Planetary Sciences'.
4) Student 4: Demands 'Global Languages' and one of either 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Computer Science'.
5) Student 5: Demands one of either both 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Environmental Engineering', or 'Architecture'.

Combined by count:
- 'Computer Science': Student 1 and 4
- 'Planetary Sciences': Student 1, 2 and 3
- 'Architecture': Student 1 and 5
- 'Business': Student 2 and 3
- 'Global Languages': Student 3 and 4
- 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Environmental  Engineering': Each Subject only addresses the demand of Only 1 Student.

We see that 'Computer Science', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Architecture', 'Business' and 'Global Languages' are subjects demanded by more than 1 student. Even though we could add 'Business' and satisfy two students, it would not also satisfy the conditions of any other student. Therefore, we choose to add 'Planetary Sciences' as the fifth subject because it can potentially satisfy three students when combined with the other chosen subjects.

In this case, the school will attract Student 1, 3 and 4 – each of them will find two subjects that they are interested in. Unfortunately, it's not possible to satisfy one of these students' conditions without unsatisfying another's under the constraint of only five subjects, so only three students is the maximum we can hope to attract.

","To solve this problem, let's first understand what each student requires:

1. Student 1 needs: (Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering) or Business
2. Student 2 needs: Architecture and (Planetary Sciences or Environmental Engineering)
3. Student 3 needs: (Business and Architecture) or Computer Science
4. Student 4 needs: Business and (Supplemental Resources or Environmental Engineering)
5. Student 5 needs: Mechanical Engineering and (Literature or Mathematics)

Looking at this, the first thing we want to find is a common theme. One thing that stands out is both Math and Mechanical Engineering would satisfy two students (Student 1 and 5), allowing us to capture two birds with one stone. 

Next, we'll look for the next recurring theme. Here, Business would satisfy Student 1 and 4. Thus, adding Business to our courses can get us another student.

Thereafter, we can cover Student 3 by adding Architecture. Note that this wouldn't impact capturing any other student because there's no room for other subjects required by the students, since we can offer exactly 5 courses.

Our 5th course can either be Planetary Sciences/Environmental Engineering for Student 2 or Supplemental Resources for Student 4. Either will only attract one additional student. 

Summing up, the combination of Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Business, Architecture plus one from {Planetary Sciences, Environmental Engineering, Supplemental Resources} will attract 4 out of 5 students which is the best we can get.

","Let's try to maximize the attendance by selecting courses in such way that more students' preferences are met.

1. Global Languages: This subject is required for Student 1 and Student 5. It also helps cater to different combinations with other subjects. Hence, this should be included.
2. Mechanical Engineering: Selecting this will cover the other condition of Student 1 as well as one condition of Student 3.
3. Computer Science: This will cater to the preferences of the Student 2.
4. Planetary Sciences: If we select this as the second requirement of Student 2, it would also meet one of the requirements for Student 4.
5. Supplemental Resources: The last course should be this because it is a requisite for Student 3.

With this selection, we manage to attract 4 out of 5 students. The only student that we will not be able to attract is Student 5. The condition for student 5 can not be met as we can not include any other course without removing the course needed by another student. The combination we selected covers the maximum number of students' preferences.

- Student 2: Computer Science and Planetary Sciences are offered.
- Student 3: Supplemental Resources and Mechanical Engineering are offered.
- Student 4: Planetary Sciences is offered.

","To determine the 5 subjects that the school should offer, we'll individually review the preference of each student, keeping in mind that our goal is to reach the maximum number of students:

Student 1: Requests either (""Business"" and ""Literature"") or Mathematics. To be conservative, we'll assume only the single course of Mathematics.

Student 2: Requests either (""Business"" and ""Mathematics"") or ""Global Languages"". Since we already have Mathematics from Student 1, we'll add Business from this preference.

Student 3: Requests either (""Mechanical Engineering"" and ""Literature"") or ""Architecture"". Adding any one of these reduces possible students that can be benefitted after this, so we'll ignore this preference for now. 

Student 4: Requests either (""Mathematics"" and ""Supplemental Resources"") or ""Computer Science"". Since Mathematics is already included, we can add ""Supplemental Resources"" to accommodate this student.

Student 5: Requires ""Environmental Engineering"" and (""Supplemental Resources"" or ""Computer Science""). As ""Supplemental Resources"" is already chosen, we can simply add ""Environmental Engineering"" to satisfy the conditions for this student.

Up to this point, we've only included 4 subjects ['Mathematics', 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering'], and we've pleased Students 1, 2, 4, and 5. To maximize attendance, we should now consider the preference of student 3.

As per Student 3's request, we can fit in one more subject. From the options (""Mechanical Engineering"" and ""Literature"") or ""Architecture"", adding ""Architecture"" is the most suitable choice. This is because adding either of ""Mechanical Engineering"" or ""Literature"" wouldn't result in fulfilling the complete condition of student 3 since they require both these subjects together. Therefore, we add ""Architecture"".

By offering these 5 subjects ('Mathematics', 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Architecture'), the school will have students 1, 2, 4, 5, and 3 attending the summer program.

","Step 1: Identify common subjects in student preferences

Start by looking at the statements students made. We can see that:

- 3 students (Student 1, Student 4 and Student 5) want Business or Supplemental Resources (Student 1), Architecture (Student 4 and Student 5).
- 2 students (Student 2 and Student 3) want Environmental Engineering and Literature.
- One student (Student 3) also wants Planetary Sciences.

Since ""or"" is inclusive, offering both subjects will satisfy both Student 1 and Student 5 for Supplemental Resources and both Student 4 and 5 in case of Architecture.

Step 2: Try to maximize student satisfaction

To attract the maximum number of students, we will prioritize choices that are required by more than one student. From the list above, we can choose Business, Supplemental Resources, Environmental Engineering, Literature, and Architecture. By doing this, we will be able to get all students except Student 3 (who wants Environmental Engineering and Literature or Planetary Sciences) to attend. Though Planetary Sciences can be added by removing any single subject, it will result in losing another student since every subject included now is a requirement for at least one student.

So the answer should be - 

OFFERED COURSES: ['Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture'].

","The aim is to maximize the number of students attending the program, so we need to find a set of 5 subjects such that as many students as possible can find their preferred subjects in it.

We first analyze the conditions for each student to attend the course:

- Student 1: The subjects required are Business, Mathematics and/or Planetary Sciences.
- Student 2: The subjects required are Supplemental Resources, Environmental Engineering and/or Planetary Sciences.
- Student 3: The subjects required are Literature and either Mechanical Engineering or Planetary Sciences.
- Student 4: The subjects required are Architecture and either Supplemental Resources or Mechanical Engineering.
- Student 5: The subjects required are Mechanical Engineering and either Global Languages or Business.

Since we only have 5 subject spots, some compromises have to be made. We also notice that Planetary Sciences is a common subject for 3 students.

To maximize attendance, we can try and fulfill the conditions of the maximum number of students. 

How about offering Business and Mathematics for Student 1, Planetary Sciences for Student 1 & 2 & 3, Literature for Student 3, and Mechanical Engineering for Student 4 & 5. 

This decision will draw Student 1, 3 and partially satisfy Student 2, 4 and 5. Even though Students 2, 4, and 5 can't get both their preferred courses, they still have one course to enroll, so, this is the maximum attendance we can achieve due to the limitation of maximum 5 subjects the school can offer.

","Let's go through each student's conditional requirements one-by-one. 

Student 1 will attend if Global Languages and either Planetary Sciences or Literature are offered. 
Student 2 will attend if Business and Planetary Sciences or Supplemental Resources are offered.
Student 3 will attend if either Business and Architecture or Computer Science are offered.
Student 4 will attend if Computer Science and either Mathematics or Planetary Sciences are offered.
Student 5 will attend if Mathematics and either Global Languages or Supplemental Resources are offered.

To maximize the number of student, we can look for common subjects among these preferences, and then try to find a set of subjects that satisfies at least one of the conditions for each student.

Planetary Sciences is a common option between student 1 and 4, if it could be included, there would be a prospective of including these students.
Business is an important subject to facilitate conditions for student 2 and 3.
Global Languages covers student 1 and completed with Mathematics could open the conditions for student 5.
Given that we have only 5 slots and 4 of them are already reserved with Planetary Sciences, Business, Global Languages and Mathematics, we then have to make a decision to either choose a second subject for student 2 or 3. Completing the condition for student 3, would suffice more students as Computer Science is required by both student 3 and 4 while Supplemental Resources is only limited to student 2.

Then chosen subjects would be Planetary Sciences, Business, Global Languages, Mathematics and Computer Science.
These 5 subjects satisfy the conditions for students 1, 3, 4, and partly one of the conditions for student 5 as they may still attend as Mathematics is offered. Unfortunately, this leaves only student 2 out. His conditions would need Supplemental Resources or Architecture which wouldn't fit into the maximum of 5 classes.

All of the above concludes that with the proposed configuration, we have the maximum potential of attracting 4 students out of 5 as it is not possible to satisfy all student conditions simultaneously given the 5 subjects limit.

","Step 1: Analyze Each Student's Preferences

Let's break down each student's statement into a set of required courses:

Student 1 - 'Supplemental Resources' AND 'Architecture' OR 'Business'
Student 2 - 'Mathematics' AND 'Environmental Engineering' OR 'Global Languages'
Student 3 - 'Mathematics' AND ('Computer Science' OR 'Business')
Student 4 - 'Architecture' AND ('Global Languages' OR 'Business')
Student 5 - 'Mechanical Engineering' AND 'Environmental Engineering' OR 'Supplemental Resources'

For each statement, the student has expressed 2-3 subjects they are interested in. Some subjects appear in multiple statements.

Step 2: Choose Most Common Subjects

We want to satisfy as many students as possible, so let's choose subjects that appear most frequently across students' preferences. 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Global Languages' seem to be popular.

Step 3: Narrow Down to Five Subjects

We can only choose five subjects, so let's narrow down our choice. To maximize our chances of satisfying student preferences, let's prioritize 'Business', 'Mathematics', and 'Supplemental Resources' as they appear in multiple student's preferences.

Then, we can choose 'Architecture' and 'Environmental Engineering' to satisfy more students since each of these subjects listed by two students.

Based on our course selection:

Student 1 will attend if 'Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture' or 'Business' is offered. This is satisfied.
Student 2 will attend if 'Mathematics' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered, which is satisfied.
Students 4 will attend if 'Architecture' and 'Business' are offered. This is satisfied.
The other students won't attend, as their conditions are not fully fulfilled.

It is not possible to make more students attend, as each of them has different preferences and the school can only offer five classes. Therefore, to maximize the number of students attending these are the best courses to offer in the summer program.

Student 3: Architecture, and either Literature or Global Languages.
Student 4: Either (Literature and Planetary Sciences) or Computer Science.
Student 5: Either (Global Languages and Architecture) or Supplemental Resources.

We realize that at most three students can be simultaneously satisfied, as all of them are mandating at least two courses each, and a single student even mandating three.

Option 1: Student 1, Student 2 and Student 4: 
This is possible if 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature', 'Mathematics' and 'Computer Science' are offered by the school.

Option 2: Student 1, Student 3 and Student 5: 
This is not possible. Although 'Architecture' and 'Global Languages' are preferred by Student 3 and Student 5, there is no way to satisfy Student 1's needs within the limit of 5 courses.

Therefore, the optimum choice is the first option. Additionally, the fifth course can be any subject (among the ones remaining) without impacting the count of attending students.

The 3 students who will attend the program are 1st, 2nd and 4th students. The reason is that all their subject demands can be accommodated within the 5 subjects.

","Looking at each student's preferences:
- Student 1 would attend if Planetary Sciences and either Environmental Engineering or Mathematics are offered.
- Student 2 would attend if Computer Science and either Mathematics or Environmental Engineering are offered.
- Student 3 would attend if Literature and either Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science are offered.
- Student 4 would attend if either both Planetary Sciences and Mechanical Engineering, or Business, are offered.
- Student 5 would attend if either both Global Languages and Architecture, or Mathematics, are offered.

It is important to look for commonalities and overlaps in the preferences to maximize student participation. 

- Mathematics is chosen by three students (1, 2, 5). 
- Planetary Sciences is chosen by two students (1, 4). 
- Environmental Engineering is also chosen by two students (1, 2).
- Computer Science is chosen by two students (2, 3).

Beyond these overlaps, the remaining subjects are only chosen by one student each. By selecting Mathematics, Planetary Sciences, Environmental Engineering and Computer Science, will satisfy requirements of Students 1, 2 and partially Student 3. 

For the 5th subject, we should choose between Mechanical Engineering and Literature. Mechanical Engineering is preferred by two students (3, 4) and Literature by one (3). But, selecting any of those subjects will only fully satisfy one more student because Student 3 needs either of those two in conjunction with Computer Science.

After deliberation, we would select Mechanical Engineering because it is desired by 2 students overall, even though only one more student's preference would be fully met.

So the selection that makes the most students attend is: Mathematics, Planetary Sciences, Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering. This would make Students 1, 2 and 4 definitely attend, and partially satisfy Student 3.

","Here is how I would break down this problem:

First, let's examine the conditions for each student:

Student 1 can attend if Architecture and either Environmental Engineering or Global Languages is offered. This would either require Architecture and Environmental Engineering, or Architecture and Global Languages.

Student 2 can attend if Business and either Architecture or Computer Science is offered. This would result in either Business and Architecture or Business and Computer Science.

Student 3 can attend if Computer Science and either Mathematics or Global Languages is offered. This would result is either Computer Science and Mathematics or Computer Science and Global Languages.

Student 4 can attend if either Business and Literature is offered or if Architecture is offered. This creates three options, Business and Literature, Business and Architecture, or Literature and Architecture.

Student 5 can attend if Mathematics and either Planetary Sciences or Computer Science is offered. This creates two options, Mathematics and Planetary Sciences or Mathematics and Computer Science.

At first glance, it may seem simple to cater to everyone's needs, but we are restricted to only offer 5 subjects. So, we aim to select these subjects such that most students can attend.

We should prioritize offering the subjects that will cater to more students. It appears ""Computer Science"", ""Architecture"", and ""Business"" are the most commonly preferred subjects. They're mentioned by three, two, and two students, respectively.

To satisfy the maximum number of students, let's choose:

- ""Computer Science"": Benefits Students 2, 3 and 5.
- ""Architecture"": Benefits Students 1, 2 and 4.
- ""Business"": Benefits Students 2 and 4.

However, we need to ensure that we also offer the subjects that students want in combination with these. 

After considering the conditions, we could further choose:

- ""Mathematics"": Benefits Student 3 and 5 when Computer Science is offered.
- ""Environmental Engineering"": Benefits Student 1 when Architecture is offered.

With these five subjects (Computer Science, Architecture, Business, Mathematics and Environmental Engineering), we have:

- Student 1 attending (as we offer Architecture and Environmental Engineering),
- Student 2 attending (Architecture and Business are offered), 
- Students 3 and 5 attending (Computer Science and Mathematics are being offered).

Unfortunately, Student 4 won't attend. If we try to accommodate Student 4 by offering ""Literature"", we'd have to replace one subject which would result in one of the other students not attending. Therefore, the above combination gives the maximum number of students, which is four out of five.

","Based on the pre-requisites each student has pre-required to attend the program, it's visible that there cannot be a rule to satisfy all students.

The maximum number of students we can get to attend is 3. Given that we can only offer 5 courses, we cannot satisfy more than 3 students because there are some subjects that only 1 student would attend. 

Here's how we get 3 students:

1. Student 1 requires 'Mechanical Engineering' with either 'Global Languages' or 'Architecture'.
   To maximize, we take 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Architecture' because 'Architecture' is also required by Student 3. 
   
2. For Student 3,  we already have one of their needed courses - 'Architecture'. We also offer 'Literature' which is required by Student 3 (and nobody else). Now student 3 can also attend. 

3. To satisfy another student, we could try and incorporate subjects like 'Computer Science' which is commonly required. But to get to 5 classes, we will also have to add 'Environmental Engineering' - as Student 2 would only choose 'Computer Science' if 'Environmental Engineering' is offered along with it. This pair can then help to invite Student 2.

So we ended up with 3 students (students number 1,2 and 3) who will attend the summer classes out of 5, which is the maximum number we can get. 

Having considered all the permutations, it's not possible to include combinations that would attract the remaining students within the limits of offering only 5 classes.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:

","To answer this question, we need to determine which set of 5 courses might maximize student attendance based on the provided student statements. 

Step by step: 
1. Check the classes that are most requested by the students. We can see that ""Computer Science"" and ""Architecture"" are mentioned several times.
2. Considering the 2 classes attached to each criterion, try to envision a scenario where we can fulfill more than one student's criteria with the same classes.
3. The conditions of students 1, 4, and 5 have a common ground with 'Architecture' and 'Computer Science'. If the school offers these 2 classes, these three students would attend. 
4. So that's three students accounted for and we still can offer three more classes. 
5. Let's now look for other students whose condition might be fulfilled without offering more than 3 additional classes. 
6. Student 3's condition can be fulfilled by offering 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Global Languages' and we've still got one class left to offer.
7. If we offer an extra 'Supplemental Resources' class, it fulfills student 2's condition if we consider the first half of their condition (they did say ""Literature OR Business"" so it's not compulsory to offer both.)

Therefore, given the constraints and conditions, the 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', and 'Supplemental Resources' would allow four students out of five to attend, which is the maximum possible according to these criteria.

","Step 1: Analyze the Requirements
The first condition for every student involves one class that is definitely required for them to take the program. The second condition has two possibilities of which one is needed, meaning that having both won't attract more students. This suggests that we might need to minimize overlap of the second condition to satisfy more students.

Step 2: Identify Core Classes
- Global Languages for Student 1
- Mechanical Engineering for Student 2
- Literature for Student 3
- Supplemental Resources for Student 4
- Environmental Engineering for Student 5

By offering these five subjects, we can ensure that all students have at least one class that they're interested in, which is a good start.

Step 3: Identify Overlapping Interests
Now we want to adjust this choice such that the biggest number of students have two classes they're interested in. The only way to satisfy Student 1 is to offer either Environmental Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. But Student 2 has Mechanical Engineering as a core subject and shares the Environmental Engineering interest. This implies that we should consider offering Environmental Engineering.

To see the full effect of this, we adjust the list, replacing Global Languages with Environmental Engineering. Then we have:
- Mechanical Engineering for Student 1 and 2
- Environmental Engineering for Student 1, 2, and 5
- Literature for Student 3
- Supplemental Resources for Student 4
- Environmental Engineering for Student 5

Step 4: Choosing the Fifth Course
Now for the fifth course: At this point, we have three students planning to attend. We need to either satisfy Student 3 or 4, and since neither Mechanical Engineering nor Environmental Engineering appeal to them, we're left with a choice between Global Languages and Business, or Mechanical Engineering and Global Languages, respectively.

We already have Mechanical Engineering on our list, but adding Global Languages won't increase the total since it'll still attract only one additional student. Therefore, the last class we could replace is Literature or Supplemental Resources, and the replacement must be Business.

Step 5: The Final List
Having tried all possible replacements, the maximum number of students brought to the program from replacing a class is one. By offering Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Literature, Supplemental Resources, and Business, we can have 4 students attend.

Therefore, the classes to offer are:
