","Step 1: Find common courses from students' statements
We need to find the subjects that are often mentioned by the students. We can identify that 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Supplemental Resources' are common in the students' statements. 

Step 2: satisfying most conditions
If we pair 'Planetary Sciences' with 'Supplemental Resources', we cover the conditions of Student 2 and Student 8. 

Step 3: finding extra classes
We still can choose 3 more subjects. To find these, we look at the other conditions that students have. For Student 1 to join, we need to offer 'Computer Science'. For Student 3 to join, we need to offer 'Literature'. Finally, for Student 5 to join, we need to offer 'Business'.

Step 4: finalizing the classes 
We can keep 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Literature' and 'Business' as the final classes.

With these classes, we can have Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 5 and Student 8. It's impossible to have more students because the other statements made by students require subjects that are out of the list we have chosen.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","To solve this problem, we need to find a set of 5 courses that would satisfy as many students as possible. 

First, let's find out which subjects are most popular by seeing how many times they are mentioned by the students:
- Computer Science is mentioned by 5 students (3, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Business is mentioned by 3 students (1, 3, 5)
- Mathematics is mentioned by 1 student (1)
- Mechanical Engineering is mentioned by 4 students (5, 7, 8, 10)
- Literature is mentioned by 2 students (1, 5)
- Global Languages is mentioned by 2 students (2, 4)
- Supplemental Resources is mentioned by 3 students (2, 3, 9)
- Planetary Sciences is mentioned by 2 students (6, 8)
- Environmental Engineering is mentioned by 2 students (2, 4)

From the above, we need to consider the subjects that are mentioned the most.

However, we also need to consider the combinations the students gave. For example, student 5 will attend if Literature and either Mechanical Engineering or Business is provided, but student 2 will attend only if Supplemental Resources and either Environmental Engineering or Global Languages are provided. We can ensure all three (Literature, Mechanical Engineering, and Supplemental Resources) attend by offering Literature, Mechanical Engineering and Supplemental Resources as part of the five courses.

An initial set of courses could be ['Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Business', 'Literature']. This will cover the needs of students 3, 5, and 10. 

Next, we need to try and replace one of the 5 subjects with the remaining ones and see if we can cater to more students. We ideally want to replace the subjects that are catering to fewer students. We can see that supplemental resources, business, and literature are mentioned by 3, 3, and 2 students respectively.

Replacing 'Business' with 'Environmental Engineering' would make Student 2 able to attend, in addition to the students who were previously able to attend. However, student 3 will no longer be able to attend because 'Business' is no longer offered. So, the number of attending students doesn't change.

Rainbow replacing 'Literature' with 'Planetary Sciences', students 6 or 8 could potentially attend, in addition to the students who were previously able to attend. However, student 5 will no longer be able to attend because 'Literature' is no longer offered. So, the number of attending students doesn't change.

Therefore, no matter how we shuffle around the subjects, the maximum number of students we can get to attend is 3.

The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering'].

","In order to maximize the number of students attending the program, the school should focus on offering courses that are most frequently mentioned by the students. To do this, we need to analyze the students' statements carefully and identify recurring subjects. 

Let's examine the choices.

- Computer Science is mentioned by students 1, 3, 6 and 8 = total 4 students.
- Mathematics is mentioned by students 2, 3, 7, 9 and 10 = total 5 students.
- Planetary Sciences is mentioned by students 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10 = total 5 students.
- Environmental Engineering is mentioned by students 3, 7, 8 and 9 = total 4 students.
- Literature is mentioned by students 2 and 5 = total 2 students.
- Global Languages is mentioned by students 4 and 7 = total 2 students.
- Architecture is mentioned by students 4, 6 and 9 = total 3 students.
- Mechanical Engineering is mentioned only by student 8 = total 1 student.
- Business is mentioned only by student 1 = total 1 student.
- Supplemental Resources is mentioned by students 5 and 6 = total 2 students.

From this count, it is clear that Mathematics, Planetary Sciences, Computer Science and Environmental Engineering are the most demanded subjects, with Literature, Global Languages, Architecture and Supplemental Resources tied for the fifth spot.

However, the subjects mentioned so far constitute a pool of multiple possible combinations. To choose the best combination, let's examine the requirements of each student. The best possible subjects are the ones that satisfy the maximum number of 'AND' operations in the students' choices.

These combinations stand out:

1. Computer Science, Business, Planetary Sciences: Satisfies Student 1
2. Mathematics, Literature, Planetary Sciences: Satisfies Student 2
3. Environmental Engineering, Computer Science: Satisfies Student 3
4. Global Languages, Planetary Sciences: Satisfies Student 4
5. Supplemental Resources, Planetary Sciences: Satisfies Student 5
6. Computer Science, Architecture: Satisfies Student 6
7. Global Languages, Mathematics: Satisfies Student 7
8. Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Computer Science: Satisfies Student 8
9. Mathematics, Architecture: Satisfies Student 9
10. Planetary Sciences, Mathematics: Satisfies Student 10

Based on the above combinations, the best combination of subjects includes Mathematics and Planetary Sciences, given that they satisfy multiple students: Mathematics satisfies students 2, 7, 9, 10; and Planetary Sciences satisfies students 1, 4, 5, 10. 

Including Computer Science in the selection satisfies an additional two students (students 1 and 3). To maximize the number of students, Architecture and Environmental Engineering are also selected, satisfying students 6 and 9 respectively and student 3. In total, we satisfy 7 of the 10 students.

","Let's go step by step and see how to get as many students as possible:

The first step is to look for subjects that appear most frequently in students' preferences. After analyzing the preferences, we see that ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Environmental Engineering"", ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Planetary Sciences"" and ""Mathematics"" appear quite often, and therefore these subjects represent students' main interests.

Next, we have to ensure that our choice meets the requirements of as many students as possible. This is a more complicated part because some students' preferences are linked not only to one subject but a combination of two subjects.

Let's break it down:

- Offering ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Planetary Sciences"", and ""Mathematics"" would make Student 1 attend the program, as it matches their preferences exactly. 

- Offering ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Supplemental Resources"" aligns with Student 2 and Student 10's preferences.

- Offering ""Supplemental Resources"" satisfies part of Student 3 and Student 4’s preferences but they require one additional subject each (""Literature"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" respectively) which exceeds our limit of 5 subjects.

- Student 5 will attend if ""Mathematics"" is offered along with either ""Mechanical Engineering"" or ""Environmental Engineering"". Offering these courses also aligns with our previous choices.

- Unfortunately, the preferences of students 6, 7, 8 and 9 cannot be accommodated without going beyond the limit of 5 subjects.

In conclusion, by offering ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Mathematics"", ""Environmental Engineering"", and ""Supplemental Resources"", we get four students (Student 1, Student 2, Student 5, and Student 10) to attend the program.

","To determine the best set of 5 courses to offer, we can examine the statements made by the students to see which subjects are most popular or versatile. 

1. Student 1 will attend if Mechanical Engineering and (Literature or Business) is offered. This suggests that either Literature or Business should be offered alongside Mechanical Engineering.
2. Student 2 suggests that either Supplemental Resources and Mathematics or just Business should be offered. 
3. Student 3 suggests either a combination of Global Languages and (Planetary Sciences or Literature), indicating that Global Languages should be offered alongside either Planetary Sciences or Literature.
4. Student 4 suggest either Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering or just Architecture. 
5. Student 5 prefer either Mathematics and Business or just Literature.
6. Student 6 prefer either Computer Science and Literature or just Planetary Sciences. 
7. Student 7 prefer either Literature and Environmental Engineering or just Architecture.
8. Student 8 suggest either Environmental Engineering and (Architecture or Global Languages).
9. Student 9 suggest either Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering or just Supplemental Resources.
10. Student 10 suggest either Planetary Sciences and (Literature or Computer Science). 

To attract the maximum number of students, we should select the 5 subjects that are most common or flexible among students choices. It's immediately apparent that some subjects such as Business, Literature, and Mathematics are requested by several students, often alongside other subjects. Furthermore, offering Literature can attract 4 different students (Student 1, 3, 5, 6) if it is combined with just one other subject from their pairs. Similarly, offering Mechanical Engineering might attract 3 different students (Student 1,4,9) if it is combined with appropriate subjects from their triple. Such reasonable combinations could be: Literature + Mechanical Engineering to attract both student 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9. 

Probably the next reasonable addition can be Computer Science to attract yet another student (Student 10) if offered with Literature and Planetary Science. Until now, the selected subjects are: Literature, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science.

The remaining last two subjects can be Mathematics and Business. Student 2 will join if these two are offered and also Business is needed for student 5.

So, the selected five subjects will make 6 students (out of 10) attend the course.attract the maximum number of students which are Student 1, Student 2, Student 4, Student 5, Student 6, and Student 10.

","We want to include as many students as possible, and it seems that some interests are more common than others.

Let's see which subjects are most requested:
- Environmental Engineering: 3 requests (Students 1, 5, 8)
- Computer Science: 4 requests (Students 2, 3, 5, 9)
- Mechanical Engineering: 4 requests (Students 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Mathematics: 4 requests (Students 3, 6, 7, 10)
- Literature: 3 requests (Students 1, 6, 10)
- Supplemental Resources: 2 requests (Students 2,4)
- Planetary Sciences: 2 requests (Students 2, 9)
- Global Languages: 2 requests (Students 4, 7)
- Business: 1 request (Student 7)
- Architecture: 1 request (Student 1)

We can see that Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics are tied as the most requested subjects (4 requests each). Since the school can offer 5 subjects, let's add these three to the course list first.

Now, we need to select the remaining two courses. Picking Environmental Engineering and Literature adds 3 new students each (as no single student requested both of these subjects), which is the highest we can achieve with two subjects.

Now, we see which students will attend the program:
- Student 1: Because Environmental Engineering or Literature is offered.
- Student 3: Computer Science is offered.
- Student 5: Environmental Engineering is offered.
- Student 9: Computer Science is offered.
- Student 10: Because Literature is offered.

Hence, we can satisfy 5 students, and no other selection of subjects can satisfy more than this number.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Determining the best subjects to offer is a process of finding which subjects appear most frequently, considering that each student's acceptance is conditional on two subjects being offered. Also, as the limit is five subjects, we must ensure that we do not exceed that number.

Let's begin:

1. Checking which subjects attract most students, we find that ""Business"" and ""Supplemental Resources"" appear most often. So, let's choose these two first.

2. After choosing ""Business"" and ""Supplemental Resources"", we can satisfy student 1, student 3, student 4, plus student 8 based on their conditions. That's 4 students already.

3. If we choose ""Literature"" as the third subject, that would additionally satisfy student 9. We now have a total of 5 students that can attend the program.

4. For our fourth subject, if we choose ""Environmental Engineering"", it would add student 2 to our list, making it six students in total.

5. Finally, if we choose ""Computer Science"" as the fifth subject, with the other 4 subjects already chosen, it would still make student 2 attending the program.

Therefore, with the selection of ""Business"", ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Literature"", ""Environmental Engineering"", and ""Computer Science"", we can ensure 6 students will attend.

If we replace any of these subjects, we would not be able to get more students to attend. For example, if we replace ""Computer Science"" with ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Mechanical Engineering"", neither would provide satisfaction for more than one new student and we would lose student 2's satisfaction from ""Computer Science"". Similar logic applies to other subjects as well.

The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Put down all the choices each student might make in pairs of two if they give two or more choices. If the student gives only one choice, we list that choice once.
2. Compare these pairs and pick the most occurring pair. If they are voted by two or more students, chances are we should offer these courses to satisfy more students.
3. Continue the process until we have five courses selected.
4. If we get to a point where we can’t add more pairs in the list as it would exceed the limit of 5 courses, we then check the remaining unselected pairs: We pick a single course from the pair which has one course already in our list of courses to be offered. Out of the remaining pairs with only one course that is already in our list, we pick the one that has the maximum occurrence.

From the students choices we get these pairing;
- Student 1: ['Architecture - Mathematics','Architecture - Global Languages']
- Student 2: ['Business - Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']
- Student 3: ['Computer Science - Planetary Sciences', 'Mechanical Engineering']
- Student 4: ['Global Languages - Environmental Engineering', 'Business']
- Student 5: ['Planetary Sciences - Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences - Computer Science']
- Student 6: ['Business - Mechanical Engineering', 'Business - Computer Science']
- Student 7: ['Global Languages - Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering']
- Student 8: ['Mathematics - Literature', 'Global Languages']
- Student 9: ['Business - Literature', 'Mathematics']
- Student 10: ['Environmental Engineering - Mechanical Engineering', 'Architecture']

From here we see some pairs such as ['Architecture - Mathematics'], ['Architecture - Global Languages'], ['Business - Planetary Sciences'] that, if offered, could potentially satisfy two students. But the most recurring course pairs are ['Global Languages - Computer Science'] and ['Business - Mechanical Engineering']. Hence we can put into consideration these courses: ['Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', 'Computer Science']. 

For the 5th course, we can see the most recurring course left is 'Planetary Sciences' which can satisfy Student 5. 

This selection will leave us with these students:
- Student 5: ""I would attend the program if and only if Planetary Sciences and (Global Languages or Computer Science) is offered.""
- Student 6: ""I would attend the program if and only if Business and (Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science) is offered.""
- Student 7: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Global Languages and Computer Science) or Mechanical Engineering is offered.""

This way, we can potentially satisfy 3 students. If we pick any other combinations, we could fulfill less students or face the impossibility to satisfy their conditions due to the limit of exactly 5 courses.

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","The problem suggests a satisfiability problem: choosing specific courses to satisfy as many students as possible, considering the conditions they have given. We can easily break the solution steps into three parts:

1) Most Common Courses
We will dig into the students' preferences, picking out the most common courses. This gives an initial estimate of the possible course set, with which we satisfy most students.

Looking at the statements of all students, you will observe that the following subjects come up often: Mechanical Engineering, Global Languages, Business, Computer Science, and Supplemental Resources.

2) Student Preferences
Check how many students' requirements will be fulfilled by choosing the most common courses. These are chosen based on the statements students:

Student 1: Fulfills the condition as Mechanical Engineering and Global Languages is in the set.
Student 2: Doesn't fulfill the condition as Mathematics is not in the set.
Student 3: Doesn't fulfill the condition as Planetary Sciences is not in the set.
Student 4: Doesn't fulfill the condition as Environmental Engineering and Planetary Sciences is not in the set.
Student 5: Doesn't fulfill the condition as Environmental Engineering is not in the set.
Student 6: Fulfills the condition as Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science is in the set.
Student 7: Fulfills the condition as Supplemental Resources and Global Languages are in the set.
Student 8: Doesn't fulfill the condition as Environmental Engineering is not in the set.
Student 9: Fulfills the condition as Global Languages, Business, and Computer Science are all in the set.
Student 10: Fulfills the condition as Business and Mechanical Engineering are in the set.

Therefore from our selected subjects: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', 'Business', 'Computer Science', 'Supplemental Resources', students 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, a total of 5 students will attend.

3) Optimization
From here, it's challenging to find better alternatives because of the hard restriction that exactly 5 subjects can be offered. Any change in the subject list will drop some satisfied students, and would not necessarily increase the overall count.

Therefore, while understanding it may not fully satisfy all students, we selected the classes that can maximize student participation considering constraints.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","To figure out the best 5 courses to offer, we will first need to analyze the students' conditions and group them based on the overlaps in preferences.

Let's group the students' conditions into 2 groups:

1. Literatures, Business, Supplemental resources & Architecture have heavy overlaps.

Student 1: Supplemental Resources, Architecture or Literature
Student 3: Business and (Architecture or Computer Science)
Student 7: Business and (Literature or Mechanical Engineering)
Student 8: Global Languages and (Business or Literature)
Student 9: Global Languages and (Literature or Architecture)

2. Computer Science & Global Languages, Business, Mechanical Engineering have heavy overlaps.

Student 2: Computer Science and (Architecture or Supplemental Resources)
Student 4: (Mathematics and Supplemental Resources) or Global Languages
Student 5: (Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science) or Business
Student 6: Environmental Engineering and (Business or Global Languages)
Student 10: (Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science) or Global Languages

We can attract more students by observing group 1 since it has more than 5 different subjects. Since the 'Supplemental resources & Architecture' introduces two subjects at once, we have to consider more favorable subjects like 'Literature' and 'Business' which are in the preferences of 3 students respectively. Offering 'Global Languages' can attract 2 more students (Student 8 and 9).

For the 5th subject, we can either choose between 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Architecture'. By choosing 'Supplemental Resources', we can satisfy Student 1, or by choosing 'Architecture', we can satisfy Student 9. However, both options only attract one more student, so we can choose either of those.

Let's provide 'Supplemental Resources'.

Hence, by selecting these 5 subjects - 'Literature', 'Business', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', we can attract a maximum of 6 different students (Student 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9).

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Step 1: To start, let's identify the most popular subjects based on the students' preferences.

- Computer Science is preferred by Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 5, and Student 10
- Architecture is preferred by Student 4, Student 5, Student 6, and Student 8
- Global Languages is preferred by Student 1, Student 5, Student 6, and Student 9
- Mechanical Engineering is preferred by Student 2, Student 4, and Student 10
- Supplemental Resources is preferred by Student 2, Student 7, and Student 9
- Literature is preferred by Student 3 and Student 7
- Mathematics is chosen by Student 3, Student 7, and Student 10
- Environmental Engineering is preferred by Student 1 and Student 6
- Business is only preferred by Student 4
- Planetary Sciences is not chosen by any student

Step 2: Looking at these figures, we see that Computer Science and Architecture have been chosen the most. Since one of the goals is to have as many students attend the program as possible, the school should definitely offer these two subjects. Along with these two, Global Languages also covers a large student base. So we can add these three subjects to our list.

Step 3: We have now two slots remaining. We have to choose between Mechanical Engineering, Supplemental Resources, Literature, Mathematics, Environmental Engineering, and Business. As we can see Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics are chosen by 3 students, which is the next highest number of students. 

Step 4: If you check all the combinations, it is clear that choosing 'Mechanical Engineering' will give you 2 students(Student-2, and Student-10). Now, although Mathematics is also chosen by 3 students, picking 'Mathematics' is not beneficial here, as it does not result in any additional students because those who choose Mathematics also choose Computer Science.

Step 5: Now we are left for the last choice. Remaining options are Supplemental Resources, Literature, Environmental Engineering, and Business. If we pick 'Environmental Engineering', we can get additional student (Student-1). The other options are not beneficial as none of them present an opportunity to add an additional student.

","In order to solve this, each statement should be broken down to understand the combinations necessary per student. It's also important to note that each student has two sets of combinations for their preferences and for the majority of the students, 'Supplemental Resources' is a recurring subject. Every pair has at least one recurring subject. 

This emphasizes the need to consider 'Supplemental Resources' as a given choice and then analyze which other subjects should accompany it to ensure maximum participation.

Student 1: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Supplemental Resources and Planetary Sciences) or Environmental Engineering is offered.""
- Supplemental Resources AND Planetary Sciences OR 
- Environmental Engineering 

Student 3: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Supplemental Resources and Mathematics) or Business is offered.""
- Supplemental Resources AND Mathematics OR 
- Business

Student 5: ""I would attend the program if and only if Global Languages and (Supplemental Resources or Mathematics) is offered.""
- Global Languages AND 
  - Supplemental Resources OR
  - Mathematics

Student 7: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science) or Supplemental Resources is offered.""
- Mechanical Engineering AND Computer Science OR 
- Supplemental Resources

Student 9: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Supplemental Resources and Computer Science) or Business is offered.""
- Supplemental Resources AND Computer Science OR 
- Business

From the breakdown, it's clear that along with 'Supplemental Resources', the subjects preferred most are 'Mathematics' and 'Business'. If I include these 3 courses, I'll be able to please Students 3, 7, 9 and possibly 5. For the fourth course, I can add 'Planetary Sciences' to please Student 1. For the fifth, either of 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Global Languages' could be added, but since 'Computer Science' shows up twice, it will cover Students 5 and 7.

Therefore, the school can offer 'Supplemental Resources', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Computer Science'. This way Students 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 would attend. If any one of these subjects is dropped, less students will participate meaning that no other set of 5 subjects gets more attendants.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","The goal is to choose 5 subjects such that as many students will attend the program.

The best way to approach this problem is to find patterns and common subjects among students' preferences.

First, let's identify the courses that are most commonly referenced:

1. Supplemental Resources is in the choices of 4 students.
2. Computer Science is in the choices of 4 students.
3. Architecture is in the choices of 3 students.
4. Mechanical Engineering is in the choices of 3 students.
5. Mathematics is in the choices of 3 students.
6. Other subjects are not repeated more than 2 times.

Now, if we choose the most common subjects, we cover the most of the students (but not necessarily all of their conditions are met, so not all of them are attending the program):
['Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mathematics']

Let's break down which students will attend based on above selection:

- Student 1: No, because Literature is not on offer.
- Student 2: Yes, Computer Science or Supplemental Resources is offered.
- Student 3: No, because both Supplemental Resources and either of Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering are not on offer.
- Student 4: No, because both Mathematics and Supplemental Resources are not on offer.
- Student 5: Yes, because both Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering is on offer.
- Student 6: No, because neither both of Architecture, Global Languages nor Business are on offer.
- Student 7: Yes, because either both of Computer Science, Planetary Sciences or Mechanical Engineering is on offer.
- Student 8: No, because Global Languages is not on offer.
- Student 9: No, because neither both of Mathematics, Planetary Sciences or Architecture are on offer.
- Student 10: No, because neither both of Planetary Science, Mathematics or Computer Science are on offer. 

From the above analysis, there is only possible for 3 students to attend the program. To attract most students, we should prioritize the subjects that appear in most conditions. By analyzing the statements, we can see that choosing ['Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering'] would satisfy Student 2, 5 and 7. 

It is not possible to satisfy more students because we are limited to offer exactly 5 subjects and there is not enough overlap in the students' preferences to be able to cover more students with the remaining two choices.

","First, let's count the frequency of each subject mentioned by the students. This will give us a general idea of the most desired subjects.

- Computer Science: 1
- Business: 2
- Mathematics: 4
- Mechanical Engineering: 2
- Literature: 5
- Architecture: 2
- Global Languages: 2
- Supplemental Resources: 3
- Planetary Sciences: 2
- Environmental Engineering: 3

Right now, the five most mentioned subjects are Literature, Mathematics, Environmental Engineering, Supplemental Resources, and then either Business, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Global Languages, or Planetary Sciences.

However, just because those subjects are most desired overall, it doesn't mean that offering them will result in the highest student attendance. We also have to consider the conditions the students made. Let's find the subjects combinations that could work.

If we choose 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business', students 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 would attend.

If we choose 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences', students 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 would attend.

If we choose 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences', students 1, 4, 5, 7 and 10 would attend.

These are the best combinations we could find, and they each allow 5 students to attend, or half of the total number of students. There seems to be no better combination because none of the conditions overlapping more than they do now, so we cannot increase the total number of attending students beyond 5.

For this solution, I will choose the last combination because it includes the subject 'Supplemental Resources' which might offer support in any subject for students.

","Step 1: Identify most common subjects  
Looking through the students' statements, we can try to identify the subjects that come up most frequently. These are:  
  
-Business  
-Literature  
-Planetary Sciences  
-Mechanical Engineering  
-Environmental Engineering  

Step 2: Define combinations  
We then analyze the combinations that are given. The most efficient scenario is to have overlap in subjects among the students' conditions. Since we are looking for the maximum number of students attending, we need to consider the combinations that cover the most students.  

For Business: Students 1, 2,  4, 8, 10 mentioned Business
For Literature: Students 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 mentioned Literature 
For Planetary Sciences: Students 1, 6, 9, 10 mentioned Planetary Sciences  

We note that offering Business, Literature, and Planetary Sciences will satisfy many students but not all. So next we need to look at the remaining choices for the other two courses to offer. In order to benefit the most students, we probably want to consider the conditions required for students 1, 2, and 4, as they have already been partially satisfied by our first three choices.  

For Student 1: Either Mechanical Engineering or Business + Planetary Sciences. We're already offering the latter two.
For Student 2: Either Environmental Engineering or Literature + Business. We're already offering the latter two.
For Student 4: Either Literature or Business + Mechanical Engineering. We're already offering the first two.  

So by offering Business, Literature, Planetary Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, and Environmental Engineering, we can satisfy students 1, 2, 4, and either 5 or 6 (depending on whether Environmental Engineering or Literature is more valuable), but not both.  

Step 3: Analysis  
After a thorough analysis, it is determined that offering Business, Literature, Planetary Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering allows the attendance of students 1, 2, 4, 5 (through Literature), 6 (through Environmental Engineering).  

Step 4: Finalize the list  
Lastly, list these five subjects under the OFFERED COURSES label.

","If the objective is to allow as many students as possible to attend, we need to consider the subjects that were mentioned by many. 

Student 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 mentioned 'Mechanical Engineering'. Therefore, that should be one of the offered subjects. 

Next, 'Architecture' is mentioned by Student 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9. Hence, we should include 'Architecture'. 

Student 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 mentioned 'Planetary Sciences' making it a good subject to offer.

Now that three subjects have been decided, we can look at the other remaining requirements to determine the final two subjects. 

In order to include the conditions of Student 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 (who have mentioned any of the first three subjects) we need to offer 'Computer Science'. 

By including the four mentioned subjects (Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Planetary Sciences, and Computer Science) we already have chosen by the conditions of Student 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7.

To select the final subject, we can look at the remaining subjects in the conditions of all the students. From the five students we have satisfied, Student 2's condition also included 'Mathematics' and 'Supplemental Resources'. Student 5, 6 and 7 are already covered since we included all the subjects of their conditions. 

Hence, the final subject could be either Mathematics or Supplemental Resources.

Now if we look at the students whose conditions haven't been covered yet (Student 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10), we find that:

- Student 3 will attend if Mathematics is offered which is one of our final candidates for the fifth subject.

- Student 4 and 9's conditions cannot be satisfied since we can't offer any more of the additional subjects they listed.

- Student 8 and 10 will attend if Supplemental Resources is offered, which is our other final candidate for the fifth subject.

Given that, if we select 'Mathematics', it would result in 6 students being able to attend, and if we select 'Supplemental Resources', it will result in 7 students in total being able to attend.

So, the five subjects that should be offered are: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Architecture', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science', and 'Supplemental Resources'. This guarantees attendance by 7 students out of 10 possible.

","The first step is to analyze each statement, to see which subjects are in ""demand"" and to see the dependencies between them. For example, Student 1 would attend if ""Architecture AND Supplemental Resources"" is offered, or if ""Planetary Sciences"" is offered. This means that to satisfy Student 1, we either need to offer Architecture with Supplemental Resources or Planetary Sciences alone.

Doing similar analysis for all statements we find these groups:

1. Architecture, Supplemental Resources.
2. Mechanical Engineering, Supplemental Resources.
3. Literature, Mechanical Engineering.
4. Environmental Engineering, Literature.
5. Environmental Engineering, Computer Science.
6. Global Languages, Business.
7. Planetary Sciences (requires no other subject along with it).
8. Computer Science (requires no other subject along with it).

Looking at these pairs, it's apparent that Supplemental Resources, Mechanical Engineering and Literature are in high demand because they each appear in at least two combinations.

Based on this, one way to satisfy most students would be to choose 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering', and 'Literature' as three of the subjects. 

Now, we choose 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Planetary Sciences' as the remaining two subjects. 

Here is why:

Student 1: Fulfilled by 'Planetary Sciences'.
Student 2: Fulfilled by 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mechanical Engineering'.
Student 3: Fulfilled by 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering'.
Student 4: Not fulfilled.
Student 5: Fulfilled by 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature'.
Student 6: Fulfilled by 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature'.
Student 7: Not fulfilled.
Student 8: Fulfilled by 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering'.
Student 9: Not fulfilled.
Student 10: Not fulfilled.

So, 6 out of 10 students will attend, providing we choose these 5 subjects. We can't choose another combination because all require removing a subject required by one of our combinations, which would result in fewer than 6 students attending.

","First, let's analyze the requirements of each student:

Student 1: Planetary Sciences and (Global Languages or Literature)
Student 2: (Literature and Mathematics) or Environmental Engineering
Student 3: Computer Science and (Mechanical Engineering or Global Languages)
Student 4: Global Languages and (Literature or Architecture)
Student 5: (Global Languages and Mathematics) or Computer Science
Student 6: (Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics) or Environmental Engineering
Student 7: (Business and Environmental Engineering) or Literature
Student 8: Planetary Sciences and (Supplemental Resources or Mathematics)
Student 9: (Global Languages and Planetary Sciences) or Architecture
Student 10: (Architecture and Computer Science) or Environmental Engineering

It's important to note that offering a subject that is part of an ""and"" condition will only attract a student if the other part of the condition is also offered.

After some consideration, a good rule of thumb would be to try to meet the requirements of the students that have ""or"" conditions, since those give us more flexibility to attract more students. 

However, we also have to consider that the amount of subjects we can offer is limited to 5, and a good number of students require ""Global Languages"". That means we would need to pick this course, and probably ""Planetary Sciences"" as well for Student 1. Student 2 also requires Environmental Engineering so we have to offer this course.

We also may consider offering Mathematics since many students require it, and finally we can offer Literature - it satisfies the conditions for Student 1, 2, 4, and 7 to join the Summer program.

Now, let's see which students will attend according to this choice:

Student 1: Planetary Sciences (yes), Global Languages or Literature (yes)
Student 2: Literature and Mathematics or Environmental Engineering (yes)
Student 3: Computer Science and (Mechanical Engineering or Global Languages) (no)
Student 4: Global Languages and (Literature or Architecture) (yes)
Student 5: Global Languages and Mathematics or Computer Science (yes)
Student 6: Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics or Environmental Engineering (yes)
Student 7: Business and Environmental Engineering or Literature (yes)
Student 8: Planetary Sciences and (Supplemental Resources or Mathematics) (yes)
Student 9: Global Languages and Planetary Sciences or Architecture (yes)
Student 10: Architecture and Computer Science or Environmental Engineering (yes)

So with arranged subjects, we can satisfy the conditions 9 out of 10 students. It is not possible to satisfy more students with only five offered subjects due to the diversity of requirements the students have.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","This is a complex task: we need to select the optimal combination of courses in order to maximize the student attendance. Let's break this problem into smaller steps:

1. Firstly, it is noticeable that some courses are being mentioned more often than others. This suggests that we may need to prioritize them in order to get as many students as possible to attend. Let's look at the distribution of the courses among students preferences:

- 'Computer Science' : Not mentioned by any student
- 'Business' : Mentioned by student 1 and 4
- 'Mathematics' : Mentioned by student 1, 4, 5
- 'Mechanical Engineering' : Mentioned by student 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 'Literature' : Mentioned by student 3, 7, 10
- 'Architecture' : Mentioned by student 4, 6, 8, 9
- 'Global Languages' : Mentioned by student 8, 9
- 'Supplemental Resources' : Mentioned by student 1, 2, 3, 7
- 'Planetary Sciences' : Mentioned by student 2, 6, 9, 10
- 'Environmental Engineering' : Mentioned by student 3, 5, 10

2. Next, we should realize that 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are mentioned by most of the students (4 each) followed by 'Planetary Sciences', 'Mathematics', 'Architecture' and 'Literature' which are mentioned by 3 students each. Therefore, it might be beneficial to have these courses included in the Summer program.

3. However, we also need to notice that some students can attend if only one of their required subjects are there. For instance, student 1 can attend if either (Mathematics and Business) or Supplemental Resources is offered, so offering just Supplemental Resources might be enough for this student to attend.

4. By considering the highest frequency and accommodating the preferences of as many students as possible, offering the following 5 subjects: 'Mechanical Engineering', Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Mathematics' and 'Architecture' would ensure maximum attendance. 

Here is how these subjects correspond to each student's preference:
- Student 1: Can attend because of 'Supplemental Resources'
- Student 2: Can attend because of ('Mechanical Engineering' and 'Supplemental Resources') 
- Student 3: Can attend because of 'Supplemental Resources'
- Student 4: Can't attend because neither both ('Business' and 'Mathematics') nor ('Business' and 'Architecture') are offered.
- Student 5: Can attend because of 'Mechanical Engineering'
- Student 6: Can attend because of ('Architecture' and 'Mechanical Engineering')
- Student 7: Can attend because of ('Supplemental Resources' and 'Mechanical Engineering') 
- Student 8: Can attend because of 'Architecture'
- Student 9: Cannot attend because neither both ('Global Languages' and 'Planetary Sciences') nor ('Global Languages' and 'Architecture') are offered.
- Student 10: Can attend because of 'Planetary Sciences'

So, by offering these 5 courses, 8 out of 10 students would attend the program. We can't make more students attend because even if we swap out a course, we would lose more students than we would gain.

","This problem involves identifying which combination of 5 courses is to be chosen from a list of 10 available courses. The goal is to maximize the number of students who will attend the summer program by satisfying as many of their ""if and only if"" conditions as possible.

Let's analyze:

Student 1 is satisfied by ('Computer Science' and ('Planetary Sciences' or 'Business'))
Student 2 is satisfied by ('Global Languages' and ('Architecture' or 'Literature'))
Student 3 is satisfied by (('Environmental Engineering' and 'Literature') or 'Business')
Student 4 is satisfied by ('Architecture' and ('Literature' or 'Business')) 
Student 5 is satisfied by ('Literature' and ('Computer Science' or 'Mechanical Engineering'))
Student 6 is satisfied by (('Mechanical Engineering' and 'Business') or 'Supplemental Resources')
Student 7 is satisfied by (('Business' and 'Environmental Engineering') or 'Global Languages')
Student 8 is satisfied by (('Environmental Engineering' and 'Global Languages') or 'Planetary Sciences')
Student 9 is satisfied by ('Literature' and ('Planetary Sciences' or 'Mathematics')) 
Student 10 is satisfied by ('Global Languages' and ('Mechanical Engineering' or 'Business'))

By analyzing each condition, we can identify that the course ""Literature"" appears 5 times, the course ""Business"" appears 5 times, ""Environmental Engineering"" appears 3 times, ""Global Languages"" appears 3 times, ""Computer Science"" appears 2 times, and ""Mechanical Engineering"" also appears 2 times. Other courses like ""Architecture"", ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Planetary Sciences"", and ""Mathematics"" appears fewer times. 

It's intuitive from this point to focus on the courses that are chosen most often, with a third slot shared by ""Environmental Engineering"", and ""Global Languages"". For the courses that appears 2 times ""Computer Science"", and ""Mechanical Engineering"", we can go with ""Computer Science"" by assuming popularity.

Thus, we can choose 'Literature', 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Global Languages', and 'Computer Science'. 

Offering these courses will mean the following students attend:

Student 1: ""I would attend the program if and only if Computer Science and (Planetary Sciences or Business) is offered."" - Attends because of 'Computer Science' and 'Business'

Student 2: ""I would attend the program if and only if Global Languages and (Architecture or Literature) is offered."" - Attends because of 'Literature' and 'Global Languages'

Student 3: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Environmental Engineering and Literature) or Business is offered."" - Attends because of 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature' and 'Business'

Student 5: ""I would attend the program if and only if Literature and (Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering) is offered."" - Attends because of 'Literature' and 'Computer Science'

Student 7: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Business and Environmental Engineering) or Global Languages is offered."" - Attends because of 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Global Languages'

So by offering the classes defined we have managed to convince 5 out of 10 students to attend. It's not possible to get more to attend because adding or removing any one class from our list causes the number of students who attend to fall.

","Let's start by analyzing the subjects each student requires. 

Student 1: ""I would attend the program if and only if Mathematics and (Literature or Business) is offered.""
Student 2: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Environmental Engineering and Mathematics) or Computer Science is offered.""
Student 3: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Business and Environmental Engineering) or Mathematics is offered.""

Student 9: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Literature and Environmental Engineering) or Planetary Sciences is offered.""
Student 10: ""I would attend the program if and only if Business and (Computer Science or Literature) is offered.""

From here we can see that most repeated subjects are:

- Mathematics
- Environmental Engineering
- Literature
- Business
- Computer Science

We can assume that these subjects are the most popular ones among the students based on the requirements. Thus, offering these courses may attract maximum attendance.

Based on the above list of subjects, the students who will attend are:

- Student 1: Because Mathematics and Literature are offered.
- Student 2: Because Mathematics and Environmental Engineering are offered, or Computer Science is offered.
- Student 3: Because Environmental Engineering and Mathematics, or Business are offered.
- Student 7: Because Environmental Engineering is offered along with Computer Science.
- Student 10: Because Business and Computer Science, or Literature are offered.

Other students won't attend because none of their required pair of subjects is completely covered in the selected five subjects. Also, changing any subject from the selected list with any new subject might decrease the total number of attending students. So it is not possible to make more students attend.

","To maximise the number of students attending, we should consider the subjects which appear most frequently in students' conditions. Then, we choose combinations that satisfy most students. 

'Computer Science' appears in 4 of the conditions (students 4, 5, 6, and 8), making it a strong choice. 

Of the remaining subjects, 'Planetary Sciences', 'Global Languages', and 'Mathematics' seem to appear most frequently (in 3 conditions each). We could thus attempt to satisfy the students 1, 3, 5, and 6 requests, as they collectively cover these subjects. 

However, student 3's request for 'Planetary Sciences' and ('Mathematics' or 'Mechanical Engineering') cannot be fulfilled alongside students 1, 4, and 5's conditions, as we cannot offer 'Mechanical Engineering'. 

However, the conditions of students 1, 4, 6, 7, and 10 can be fulfilled if you offer 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Planetary Science', 'Global Languages' and 'Supplemental Resources'. This combination would allow 5 students to attend the summer school.

Let's double-check:
- Student 1: Mathematics and Global Languages are offered.
- Student 4: Computer Science is offered.
- Student 6: Global Languages and Computer Science are offered.
- Student 7: Planetary Sciences and Supplemental Resources are offered.
- Student 10: Planetary Sciences is offered.

Confirming, these 5 subjects meet our goal to allow the greatest number of students to attend the program.

","Since we need to satisfy as many students as we can, and each student lists two or three different subjects, we should look for a common pattern, subjects that are repeated across different conditions set by the students.

By looking at the courses picked by each student, we can see that 'Mathematics' and 'Computer Science' are the most frequent courses.

Let's explore step by step:

- If the school selects 'Mathematics', Students 1, 2, 4, 9, and 10 will attend
- If the school selects 'Computer Science', Students 1, 4, 5, and 7 may attend in conjunction with their other choices

Along with 'Mathematics' and 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering' seems the next most popular subject.

- This will make Student 1 and Student 3 potentially attend given we will already have 'Mathematics'

Taking 'Global Languages' as another subject will allow Student 5, 6, 9, and 10 potentially to attend, given the availability of the other subjects they need.

To accommodate as many students as we can, we need to choose the right course for the last spot. Here 'Literature' seems to fit most, as that course will make Student 8, 9, and 10 attend given we already have 'Global Languages' and 'Mathematics'.

In conclusion, 'Mathematics', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', and 'Literature' are the five subjects with the highest occurrence in the student's preferences. This selection will increase the chances of more students attending the summer program.

The students who will attend the program are: 

- Student 1: Because 'Mathematics', 'Computer Science' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered.
- Student 4: Because 'Mathematics' and 'Computer Science' are offered.
- Student 5: Because 'Global Languages' and 'Computer Science' are offered.
- Student 9: Because 'Global Languages', 'Mathematics', and 'Literature' are offered.
- Student 10: Because 'Global Languages', 'Mathematics', and 'Literature' are offered.

Each course listed is required by other students as well but they require one more course which cannot be accommodated as we can only offer 5 courses at max.

","Step 1: Survey Analysis

After a thorough examination of the students' statements, we find:

1. Most students will attend the program if ""Supplemental Resources"" (required by the statements of 3 students: 3, 4, 10) or ""Computer Science"" (required by the statements of 4 students: 1, 4, 5, 7) is offered.
2. ""Architecture"" (required by the statements of 4 students: 2, 6, 8, 9) is another high-demand subject. 
3. ""Environmental Engineering"" (required by statements of 3 students: 2, 4, 8) and ""Business"" (required by statements of 2 students: 1, 9) are needed but less than the above.

However, we have a restriction that we can only offer 5 subjects and must leverage these resources to accommodate the preference of the maximum number of students.

Step 2: Final Subject Selection

Taking into account all the mentioned points above, one of the combinations to accommodate the maximum number of students is:

1. ""Computer Science"" - It will accommodate the preferences of Students 1, 4, 5, 7
2. ""Supplemental Resources"" - It will accommodate Students 3, 4, 5, 10
3. ""Architecture"" - It will accommodate Students 2, 6, 8
4. ""Environmental Engineering"" - It will allow Students 2 and 4 to get their subject preference.
5. ""Business"" - It would provide an additional push to Student 1 who wants either ""Computer Science"" or ""Business""

With these selections, the following students can attend: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, while the combination can't accommodate the preferences of Students 9. We can't make more students attend with these or any other combination of 5 subjects due to the intersecting and collective demands of the students.

","First, it can be seen that 'Mathematics' is the most mentioned subject, followed by 'Business', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering'. So, focusing on them seems adequate.

1. 'Mathematics' is the preference of students 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10. Among these, student 3 requires 'Literature' or 'Computer Science' with 'Mathematics' and student 10 requires 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Supplemental Resources' with 'Mathematics' which appear less frequent. Therefore, initial subjects can be 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering' (from student 1), 'Business' (from student 2).

2. 'Business' is the preference of students 2, 4, 6, 9. Among these, student 9 adds more variety that is not needed, so assuming 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business' are offered, student 4 becomes a suitable choice for 4th subject: 'Computer Science'.

3. The fifth and final subject choice depends on the remaining students. Here are the possibilities:
- Student 5 adds value by introducing 'Supplemental Resources', but neither 'Literature' or 'Environmental Engineering' fit the elements currently in our list.
- Student 6 only adds value by introducing 'Literature', but it is a less frequent subject.
- Student 7 and 8 can be ruled out as they require 'Literature' and/or 'Architecture'.
- Student 9 can be ruled out as 'Environmental Engineering' was an issue with Student 5 already.
- Student 10 fails same as student 5 due to 'Environmental Engineering'.

Among these, Student 6 is the most valuable as 'Literature' appears more frequent than 'Supplemental Resources' or 'Environmental Engineering'. Therefore, the fifth subject can be 'Literature'.

With these choices, 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business', 'Computer Science' and 'Literature', a maximum of 4 students can attend; namely Student 1, 2, 4, 6.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","To solve this, we must identify which subjects are most frequently selected by the students, therefore benefitting most students. The focus should be on subjects that are repeated in different options provided by the same student, thus promoting more flexibility.

Let's start by identifying the most common subjects:
1. 'Computer Science': Students 1, 2, 3, 10
2. 'Mechanical Engineering': Students 1, 4
3. 'Literature': Students 2, 3
4. 'Business': Students 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
5. 'Environmental Engineering': Students 3, 4, 5, 9
6. 'Supplemental Resources': Students 2, 6, 8
7. 'Planetary Sciences': Students 6, 10
8. 'Mathematics': Students 5, 8, 9, 10
9. 'Architecture': Students 5, 7
10. 'Global Languages': Students 1, 7

From the above analysis, it is clear that 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Mathematics' are among the top preferences. Choosing these 3 will unlock attendance of Students 4, 9 (Business, Environmental Engineering), and possibly more.

For the remaining 2 subjects, 'Computer Science' stands out as it caters to three Students 1, 2, 3. However, choosing it only ensures the attendance of Student 1 since Global Languages is already chosen (Business, Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Global Languages).

The last course to offer should be either 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', or 'Planetary Sciences' since each appeals to 2 unknown students. Choosing 'Literature' attracts Student 3 to our choices (Business, Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Global Languages, Literature).

Hence, our final selection of subjects enables the maximum attendance of 4 students -- Students 1, 3, 4, 9.

","The task here is to choose 5 subjects in such a way that they maximize the number of students that will attend the program. To do this we need to identify the subjects that are mentioned the most by the students. However, we have to be careful in evaluating ""either or"" statements as they allow for more flexibility. We should also focus on combinations of subjects that satisfy as many students as possible.

First, let's list the subjects mentioned by students:

Mechanical Engineering - mentioned by student 1, 4, 5, 10
Environmental Engineering - mentioned by student 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10
Global Languages - mentioned by student 1, 4, 6, 10
Computer Science - mentioned by student 2, 5, 7, 9
Mathematics - mentioned by student 2, 3, 5
Supplemental Resources - mentioned by student 2, 6, 9
Planetary Sciences - mentioned by student 3, 7, 8
Literature - mentioned by student 8
Architecture - mentioned by student 9
Business - mentioned by student 8

From this, we can see that Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science are popular choices as they were mentioned by 6, 4, and 4 students respectively. However, choosing just these three subjects would only satisfy 3 students (student 1, 4, and 7). Global Languages and Mathematics also have significant demand.

Next, I looked specifically at students' statements that only require two subjects to be satisfied, namely student 1, 4, 6 and 10. By choosing Mechanical Engineering and Environmental Engineering we satisfy Student 1, 4 and 10. To satisfy one more student, we can consider offering supplemental resources, but this subject only satisfies student 2. Alternatively, we can offer Computer Science, which also only satisfies one additional student (student 5).

For the fifth class, we could consider offering Global Languages, which satisfies student 6, bringing the total students that will attend to 5.

In conclusion, by opting for Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Global Languages we assure that 5 students attend the Summer program, namely student 1, 4, 5, 6 and 10.

","Let's try to tackle this step by step:

1. First, we must understand that there is no possibility of satisfying every student's condition. So, we must aim for a combination of subjects that covers the preferences of the most number of students.

2. Let's start by examining the students who have singular subjects in their respective preferences.

   - Student 1, 4 and 6 have 'Supplemental Resources' as one of their choices. 
   - Student 2 and 6 have 'Architecture' as one of their choices.
  
3. From these observations we can gather that, choosing 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Architecture' will pull in at least two students each. 

4. Supplemental Resources and Architecture cover Student 1, 2, 4 and 6. Two more subjects can be selected.

5. Let's now look at combinations of subjects student preference:

    - Student 1: Supplemental Resources and Literature.
    - Student 2: Business and Literature.
    - Student 4: Supplemental Resources and either Business or Planetary Sciences.
    - Others require more than two additional subjects or subjects not in our current list, so ignore for now.

6. Taking 'Literature' is a reasonable third choice because it covers preferences for Student 1 and 2, resulting in a total of five students (1, 2, 4, 6, and 9).

7. As the fourth subject, choose 'Business.' This covers the condition of Student 2, 4, and 9 ending up with 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.

8. Notice that, for the fifth subject, we could choose either Planetary Sciences or Computer Science. 'Planetary Sciences' would uniquely satisfy Student 8, where as 'Computer Science' would uniquely satisfy Student 10.

So, by offering ['Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Literature', 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences'] or ['Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Literature', 'Business', 'Computer Science'], we could get six students to attend the program. No other configuration of five courses can get more than six students to attend given these conditions.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Step 1: Identify the repeating preferences:
Looking at all the requirements, we see certain courses are mentioned more than once. We can make a count:
- Business is mentioned 4 times, 
- Mathematics is mentioned 3 times, 
- Mechanical Engineering is mentioned 3 times, 
- Global Languages is mentioned 3 times, 
- Literature is mentioned 2 times, 
- Architecture is mentioned 2 times, 
- Environmental engineering is mentioned 2 times, 
- Supplemental Resources is mentioned 2 times, 
- Planetary Sciences is mentioned 2 times, 
- Computer Science is mentioned once.

Step 2: Prioritize the courses with the highest mentions:
Based on this, we want to first prioritize Business, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering and Global Languages.

Step 3: Choose the fifth course:
Since we need to choose five courses and have already selected four, for the fifth we should prioritize the course that will attract the most unique students that aren't already attracted by our previous choices. 

Looking at the requirements once again:
- If we choose Literature, it would only attract one unique student (Student 9) as the other student interested in Literature (Student 8) also requires either Business or Environmental Engineering to be offered which can't be covered due to our limit. 
- If we choose Architecture, it would attract one unique student (Student 10) as the other student interested in Architecture (Student 5) also requires Business which we have already included. 
- If we choose Environmental engineering, that would attract Student 6.
- Planetary Sciences would not attract any new student as the only students interested in it (Students 1 and 3) also require either Business or Math and Global languages respectively which we have already included.
- If we choose Computer Science, it does not attract any new students at all, as the only student interested in Computer Science (Student 4) has also shown interest in Global languages which we've already included.
- If we choose Supplemental Resources, it would attract one unique student (Student 2) as the other student interested in Supplemental Resources (Student 7) also requires Mathematics which we have already included. 

If we look carefully between Environmental engineering, Supplemental Resources, Architecture, and Literature, Environmental engineering stands out as it provides a completely unique student (Student 6), while for the others, the students they would bring in (Students 2, 10 and 9) are also interested in other subjects that we have already decided to offer (Supplemental Resources for Student 2, Mechanical Engineering for Student 10, and Global Languages for Student 9). 

Therefore, we choose Environmental engineering as the fifth course. 

Step 4: Verify our answer:
As a result, the five courses chosen are Business, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Global Languages, and Environmental Engineering. Upon checking, this would make Students 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 attend the program.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","In order to approach, this problem what we need to do is to see what the intersection of courses could maximize the number of students.

Step 1:
Analyze and group students based on their choices.

Group 1 (students interested in Business):
Student 1: 'Planetary Sciences', 'Business'
Student 2: 'Environmental Engineering', 'Business'
Student 4: 'Computer Science', 'Business'
Student 5: 'Architecture', 'Business'

Group 2 (students interested in Architecture):
Student 1: 'Planetary Sciences', 'Architecture'
Student 3: 'Architecture', 'Global Languages'
Student 5: 'Architecture', 'Business'

Group 3 (students interested in Supplemental Resources):
Student 4: 'Computer Science', 'Supplemental Resources'
Student 5: 'Supplemental Resources'
Student 7: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources'
Student 10: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources'

Group 4 (students interested in Global Languages):
Student 3: 'Architecture', 'Global Languages'
Student 6: 'Environmental Engineering', 'Global Languages'
Student 8: 'Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Mechanical Engineering'
Student 9: 'Global Languages', 'Literature' or 'Planetary Sciences'
Student 10: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages'

Group 5 (students interested in Literature):
Student 2: 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature'
Student 9: 'Global Languages', 'Literature'

Step 2:
Choosing the subjects that intersect the most to reach maximum student attendance.

We need to look for courses that appear in different student groups. By looking at the interests of the students, we can see that 'Business' and 'Architecture' can attract a large group of students when paired with 'Planetary Sciences'. 'Global Languages' can also attract a significant number of students when paired with 'Environmental Engineering'. Finally, to reach the maximum of five subjects, we can choose 'Mechanical Engineering' as the last subject since it also appeals to a significant group of students and is the remaining subject satisfying the most number of students.

These 5 courses would ensure the attendance of:

Student 1: 'Planetary Sciences', 'Business' or 'Architecture'
Student 3: 'Architecture', 'Global Languages'
Student 4: 'Business'
Student 5: 'Architecture', 'Business'
Student 6: 'Environmental Engineering'
Student 8: 'Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences'
Student 10: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages'

So we can cater to 7 out of 10 students by offering these 5 subjects.

In all alternative combinations of courses less number of students are satisfied, therefore in this problem the optimal solution is achieved with these 5 courses.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Firstly, we need to break down the preferred courses of each student:

1. Planetary Sciences, Literature or Computer Science 
2. Mechanical Engineering, Literature or Computer Science
3. Mathematics, Business or Supplemental Resources
4. Planetary Sciences, Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science
5. Mathematics, Planetary Sciences or Global Languages 
6. Architecture, Planetary Sciences or Business
7. Mechanical Engineering, Literature or Global Languages
8. Literature, Planetary Sciences or Business
9. Literature, Mathematics or Environmental Engineering
10. Literature, Planetary Sciences or Business

Now, we observe the courses that occur most often: 

- Literature: 6 times 
- Computer Science: 3 times
- Planetary Sciences: 5 times
- Mechanical Engineering: 2 times
- Mathematics: 3 times
- Business: 3 times

In addition, since we can only offer 5 distinct courses, we have to ensure that the choices can satisfy as many students as possible.

We will choose the 5 most common courses, which will allow us to get the maximum number of students.

So we have:

- Literature
- Planetary Sciences
- Computer Science
- Mathematics 
- Business

With these five subjects, the students who will attend are: 

- Student 1: Yes, because Planetary Sciences and Computer Science is offered.
- Student 2: Yes, because Literature and Computer Science is offered.
- Student 3: Yes, because Mathematics and Business are offered.
- Student 4: Yes, because Planetary Sciences and Computer Science is offered.
- Student 5: No, because Global Languages is not offered.
- Student 6: No, because Architecture is not offered.
- Student 7: No, because Mechanical Engineering is not offered.
- Student 8: Yes, because Literature, Planetary Sciences, and Business are offered.
- Student 9: Yes, because Literature and Mathematics are offered.
- Student 10: Yes, because Literature, Planetary Sciences, and Business are offered.

So, 7 of the 10 students will attend.

","The school should approach this problem by tracking the number of times each subject is mentioned by students and combining subjects that appear together in maximum options.

Step 1: Count the mentions of subjects
Each subject has been mentioned in the following way:
- Computer Science: 4 mentions
- Business: 2 mentions
- Mathematics: 3 mentions
- Mechanical Engineering: 4 mentions
- Literature: Never mentioned
- Architecture: 3 mentions
- Global Languages: 3 mentions
- Supplemental Resources: 2 mentions
- Planetary Sciences: 3 mentions
- Environmental Engineering: 4 mentions 

Step 2: Check combinations
Alongside simple counts, we observe that a few combinations seem important:
- Computer Science and Environmental Engineering: Appearing in both Student 2 and Student 4's conditions. 
- The pair of Global Languages and Architecture: Appears in student 7 and 8 preference.

Step 3: Final selection
Based on the high mentions and combinations, five subjects should be: Computer Science, Business/Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, and Environmental Engineering.

These five subjects would bring along: 
- Computer science will make both Student 1, Student 2, and Student 4 attend.
- Those also offering Environmental Engineering will additionally satisfy Student 6 and Student 10. 
- Including Mechanical Engineering will also satisfy Student 3 and Student 9.
- In case we select Mathematics over Business, Student 2 attends, but if we select Business Student 1 attends.

This way, we can have 7 students attending the Summer Program which is the highest number we can get using any permutation of 5 subjects.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Let's first break down the students' preferences:

Student 1 would attend if ""Business and Mechanical Engineering,"" or ""Mathematics"" is offered.
Student 2 would attend if ""Mechanical Engineering and (Supplemental Resources or Computer Science)"" is offered.
Student 3 would attend if ""Business and (Architecture or Planetary Sciences)"" is offered.
Student 4 would attend if ""Planetary Sciences and (Supplemental Resources or Architecture)"" is offered.
Student 5 would attend if ""(Planetary Sciences and Mathematics) or Computer Science"" is offered.
Student 6 would attend if ""(Mechanical Engineering and Literature) or Environmental Engineering"" is offered.
Student 7 would attend if ""Architecture and (Business or Computer Science)"" is offered.
Student 8 would attend if ""(Business and Mathematics) or Supplemental Resources"" is offered.
Student 9 would attend if ""(Computer Science and Environmental Engineering) or Architecture"" is offered.
Student 10 would attend if ""(Supplemental Resources and Literature) or Environmental Engineering"" is offered.

Let's see now, which subjects we can pick, so that we can satify as many students as possible:

1. The most commonly preferred subject is ""Business"", requested by students: 1, 3, 7, 8.

2. The next common one is ""Mechanical Engineering"", requested by students: 1, 2, 6.

3. ""Computer Science"" is the next one, requested by students: 2, 5, 7, 9. 

4. Then, ""Supplemental Resources"" requested by students: 2, 4, 8, 10.

5. Lastly, the subject with the most flexibility, is ""Architecture"", requested by students: 3, 4, 7, 9. 

If we offer these five subjects, all students except student #10 will attend the summer program. Because student #10 wants to attend if and only if either ""Supplemental Resources and Literature"" or ""Environmental Engineering"" are available, and we do not offer ""Literature"" and ""Environmental Engineering"".

There is no way to adjust the classes offered to get more than 9 out of 10 students to attend because no matter which other subject we replace, we lose at least one student while not gaining any.

So our maximum number of students attending will be 9 out of 10.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Firstly, we have to look at the requirement and condition of each student and see if there are any subjects that are frequently being required. 

Upon inspection, we see that 'Environmental Engineering', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', 'Mathematics' and 'Global Languages' respectively are most recurrent in the students' requirements. 

Further, we can rule out courses like 'Global Languages', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Architecture', and 'Business' and 'Mathematics'. This is because they collectively satisfy the needs of only 4 students even when offered together.

Now let's break down the preferences:
- Student 1 can be satisfied with 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Mathematics'.
- Student 2, 'Literature' and 'Supplemental Resources'.
- Student 3, 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Planetary Sciences'.
- Student 4, 'Environmental Engineering'.
- Student 5, 'Literature'.
- Student 6, 'Supplemental Resources'.
- Student 7, 'Literature'.
- Student 8, 'Literature'.
- Student 9, 'Environmental Engineering'.
- Student 10, 'Literature'.
  
From the above, it is clear that the 5 subjects that should be offered to maximize student attendance are 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Mathematics', and 'Supplemental Resources'. 

With this selection, 6 out of 10 students will attend i.e. Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 4, Student 5, and Student 10, as at least one of their preferred classes is on offer. 

By changing the courses on offer it would not be possible to cater to more than 6 out of the 10 students within the constraint of offering only 5 subjects.

Hence, the offered courses that will maximize student attendance are:

","To maximise the number of students that the school can attract, we should aim to fulfil the statements of as many students as possible with the limited number of courses. Let's break this down and find out what these are:

Step 1:
Looking at the students' responses, we can see that ""Computer Science"" and ""Architecture"" are widely popular among them (mentioned by Student 1, Student 2, Student 5, Student 6, Student 7). So let's choose these two subjects first. 

Step 2:
Next, if we choose ""Planetary Sciences"", we will satisfy Student 1, Student 4, and Student 7 as it is mentioned in their clauses. 

Step 3:
Picking ""Global Languages"" as our fourth subject would cater to Student 2, Student 3, and Student 10.

Step 4:
For our final selection, by choosing ""Business"", Student 3 and Student 6 will attend the program. Note that there are other options available for the 5th subject but choosing ""Business"" would attract 2 more students which is the maximum we can get in this scenario.

To explain our choices in another way, let's list out which students will attend:
- Student 1 will attend because Computer Science and Planetary Sciences were offered.
- Student 2 will attend because Computer Science, Architecture, and Global Languages were offered.
- Student 3 will attend because Business and Global Languages were offered.
- Student 4 will attend because Planetary Sciences was offered.
- Student 5 will attend because Architecture and Computer Science were offered.
- Student 6 will attend because Business, Computer Science and Architecture were offered.
- Student 7 will attend because Planetary Sciences and Computer Science were offered.
It is not possible to attract more students because of the limit of 5 courses and the specific combinations needed by each student.

","Let's analyze and break down the responses given by each student to determine the best combination of courses that will result in the highest possible attendance.

Student 1: Planetary Sciences, Architecture or Mathematics
Student 2: Mathematics, Literature or Global Languages
Student 3: Environmental Engineering, Computer Science or Literature
Student 4: Environmental Engineering and Business or Architecture
Student 5: Planetary Sciences, Computer Science or Business
Student 6: Architecture, Computer Science or Environmental Engineering
Student 7: Computer Science, Environmental Engineering or Mechanical Engineering
Student 8: Business and Mathematics or Architecture
Student 9: Business and Supplemental Resources or Architecture
Student 10: Mathematics, Business or Environmental Engineering

We need to offer the most commonly mentioned subjects to attract the highest number of students. At the same time, we also need to offer some combination of subjects based on how students have paired them in their preferences. 

The subjects most commonly mentioned in the students' preferences are: ""Computer Science"", ""Mathematics"", Business"", ""Architecture"", ""Environmental Engineering"". This set of 5 courses appears in 8 out of 10 student's choices. This causes the most significant student interest.

Let's determine which students will attend based on this choice:

1. Student 1 would not attend because ""Planetary Sciences"" was not offered.
2. Student 2 will attend since both ""Mathematics"" and ""Business"" were offered.
3. Student 3 will attend since both ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Computer Science"" were offered.
4. Student 4 will attend since ""Architecture"" was offered.
5. Student 5 would not attend because ""Planetary Sciences"" was not offered.
6. Student 6 will attend since both ""Architecture"" and ""Computer Science"" were offered.
7. Student 7 will attend since both ""Computer Science"" and ""Environmental Engineering"" were offered.
8. Student 8 will attend since ""Architecture"" was offered.
9. Student 9 will attend since ""Architecture"" was offered.
10. Student 10 will attend since both ""Mathematics"" and ""Business"" were offered.

By offering these subjects, we would have 8 out of 10 students attending. Any other combination of 5 subjects would result in less student attendance because they wouldn't meet the specific combinations desired by the students.

","The goal is to determine the best combination of subjects that would satisfy the highest number of students, considering the restriction that only five subjects can be offered.

Upon analyzing students' preferences:

1. 'Computer Science' appears in student 1 and 2's preferences.
2. 'Business' appears in student 2 and 7's preferences.
3. 'Mathematics' appears in student 3, and 9 and 10's preferences.
4. 'Mechanical Engineering' appears in student 3 and 8's preferences.
5. 'Architecture' appears in student 1, 4, 6 and 9's preferences.
6. 'Literature' appears in student 2, 3, 4 and 8's preferences.
7. 'Global Languages' is in student 4, 5, 6, and 10's preferences.
8. 'Supplemental Resources' appears in student 5's and 7's preferences.
9. 'Planetary Sciences' appears in student 1, 7 and 8's preferences.
10. 'Environmental Engineering' is in student 5's and 9's preferences.

If we try to satisfy as many students as possible, the solution is to offer the subjects that appear most frequently in the students' preferences. It can be inferred from the analysis above that the most request subjects are: 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Architecture', 'Literature', and 'Global Languages'. 

With these courses, the following students will attend: 

- Student 1 will attend if Computer Science and Architecture is offered.
- Student 2 will attend if Literature and Computer Science is offered.
- Student 3 will attend if Mathematics and Literature is offered.
- Student 4 will attend if Global Languages and Literature or Architecture is offered.
- Student 10 will attend if Global Languages and Mathematics is offered.

This means that 5 out of 10 students will attend, and it's not possible to make more students attend because if we include any other subject, we would end up excluding more than one student.

","The choice of subjects should accommodate as many students as possible. We need to keep in mind the following two factors:

1. The total number of subjects is limited to five. 
2. We have students with overlapping interests, and it would be most beneficial if we could identify subjects that appear most frequently in students' statements.

Let's start analyzing the statements:

- Eight out of ten statements include ""Computer Science"", ""Environmental Engineering"", or both. These subjects appear to be the most popular. Therefore, it is rational to include both of them to attract the largest number of students.

- ""Business"", ""Global Languages"", and ""Supplemental Resources"" are also popular, as six students included these subjects in their statements. However, ""Global Languages"" is more often selected as the only condition, not as part of a binary choice.

- ""Architecture"" and ""Literature"" are of medium popularity, while ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Mathematics"", ""Planetary Sciences"" are the least popular with two, one, and one mentions respectively.

After considering these factors and some experimentation to maximize the number of students attending, here's the solution:

1. Computer Science - Popular and chosen by Students 1, 5, 7, 9, 10
2. Environmental Engineering - Popular and chosen by Students 1, 7, 8, 10
3. Global Languages - Popular standalone option. Chosen by Students 4, 5, 6, 8
4. Architecture - of medium popularity, Chosen by Students 2, 6, 7, 9
5. Business - seems to be the best to maximise the number of students, Chosen by Students 1, 2, 5

By offering these 5 subjects, we can attract students 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Only students 3 and 10 won't attend.This way, it is not possible to satisfy more than 8 out of 10 students with only 5 subjects.

Student 9 - ""I would attend the program if and only if Business and (Literature or Environmental Engineering) is offered.""


Student 10 - ""I would attend the program if and only if Supplemental Resources and (Business or Planetary Sciences) is offered.""


To attract as many students as possible, let's see if we can find common courses. Supplemental Resources, Business, and Architecture seem to be present in multiple statements. Environmental Engineering and Global Languages are present in two statements and can satisfy conditions of both.

Now checking if all conditions hold, we realize:

Student 1's criteria is satisfied with Business.

Student 2's criteria cannot be satisfied as we cannot include Computer Science or Architecture.

Student 3's and Student 4's criteria cannot be satisfied as we cannot include Maths, Literature, or Architecture.

Student 5's criteria is satisfied with Environmental Engineering and Global Languages.

Student 6's criteria is satisfied with Business and Supplemental Resources.

Student 7's and Student 8's expectation cannot be satisfied because we did not include Computer Science, Planetary Sciences, or Mechanical Engineering.

Student 9's criteria is satisfied as we included both Business and Environmental Engineering.

Student 10's requirement is fulfilled as we have both Supplemental Resources and Business.

So, by offering ['Supplemental Resources', 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Global Languages'], and considering that we offer one more course to attract more students ('Literature' or 'Architecture' or 'Planetary Sciences'), we can get 5 students which is maximum possible considering that we have possibility to offer only 5 distinct subjects.

","By closely analyzing the student preferences we can derive few key points,

1. ""Mechanical Engineering"" is a preference for Student 1 and Student 2. However, it only appears in these two students' conditions, making its selection not as beneficial.

2. ""Literature"" appears quite a few times. As a preference it is chosen by Student1, Student3, Student4, and Student10. This gives it a high priority in our selection.

3. ""Global languages"" also appears quite frequently. It is a choice for Student 1, Student 2, Student 5, Student 6, Student 7 and Student 10.

4. ""Business"" is a choice for Students 4, 5, 6 and 7.

5. ""Architecture"" is a choice for Students 3, 5, 8, 10.

So the five subjects can be: 

1. ""Literature""
2. ""Global Languages""
3. ""Business""
4. ""Architecture"", and 
5. An additional subject that brings in the most students when paired with the other selected subjects.

Given these conditions, the remaining fifth subject can be 'Computer Science' as it satisfies Student 2, Student 4, Student 8. 

With these five subjects ('Literature', 'Global Languages', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Computer Science'), the students who will attend are Students 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Indeed, it is not possible to make more students attend because we've exhausted all options and only can choose five subjects. 

Therefore, the school should offer the following subjects:

","To maximize the number of students who would attend the program, the school must select at least one subject from every combination statement offered by each student. As the school has a limit of 5 subjects, this must be done very competently making sure to select subjects that have frequent occurrences and can satisfy the condition for as many students as possible. Analyzing statements, we can identify some subjects that frequently appear, such as Computer Science, Mathematics and Supplemental Resources. Let's check each with detailed analysis:

1. Computer Science is a requirement for students 1, 3, 4 and 7. It specifically appears in students 1, 3 and 4's statements alongside 'Supplemental Resources'. 

2. Supplemental Resources is a requirement for students 1, 3, 4 and 9. 

3. Mathematics is a requirement for students 2, 3, 6 and 8. Specifically, it appears with Mechanical Engineering in student 2's statement and with 'Architecture' in student 6's statement.

Considering these three subjects (Computer Science, Supplemental Resources, Mathematics), we may already satisfy the conditions for 4 students (1, 3, 4, 9). We still have two more subjects to choose that may attract more students.

For the 4th subject, 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Architecture' can be good options. However, if we choose 'Mechanical Engineering', we could potentially get student 2 to attend, but we also need to offer a 5th course in order to get student 10. Whereas if we choose Architecture, it can combine with Mathematics to attract student 6 and combine with Computer Science to attract student 7. Thus, 'Architecture' is our 4th subject.

For the 5th subject, 'Business' could attract student 5 if combined with 'Architecture' and student 6 if it's not taking part yet.

To summarize, the best subjects to be offered would be ones that meet the requirements of the highest number of students, which are 'Computer Science', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Mathematics', 'Architecture' and 'Business'. This combination would potentially attract 6 students to attend (students 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9).

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Solving this problem requires taking into account the preferences of each student and the limit of 5 courses that can be offered. To maximize the number of students attending, the school must select the group of courses desired by the largest number of students. 

Following an approach where we identify the most common subjects among the students, we are able to get a good starting point. However, we also need to make sure that we accommodate any particular course demands due to ""(A or B)"" type preferences by some students. 

On careful close examination, three classes stand out as highly requested by students: 'Computer Science', 'Global Languages' and 'Environmental Engineering'.

To maximize student attendance, the school should offer these three classes along with a mixture of the other two most common classes from the prerequisites to fulfill the maximum number of student conditions. 

Comparing the students preferences, we find that a potential combination that caters to maximum students is to additionally offer 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Architecture'.

Breakdown of which students would attend:
Student 1 will attend because 'Global Languages' and 'Architecture' are being offered.
Student 3 will attend offering 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Computer Science'.
Student 6 will attend offering 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Computer Science'.
Student 9 will attend offering 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Computer Science'.
Student 10 will attend offering 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Computer Science'.

In total 5 out of 10 students will attend. 

Given the variety of classes desired by the remaining students, no other combination of classes would result in more than half of the students attending.

","This problem can be solved by observation and logical deduction.

Firstly, one student wants only ""Supplemental Resources"", and nobody else does. So if we include this subject, we would gain only one student, but lose the opportunity to please more students if we had chosen another subject. 

Secondly, there are four subjects that three different students each want to study: Business, Computer Science, Planetary Sciences, Literature.

So we should definitely include these four: ['Business', 'Computer Science', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature']

We're left with one subject to pick. 
By looking through the remaining subjects and considering the number of students who would attend if that subject is offered, we can see that 'Mathematics' is the subject that would bring in the most students.

Student 6 would attend the program with these subjects: ['Business', 'Computer Science', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature', 'Mathematics']
Student 7 would also attend because 'Mathematics' or the combination 'Architecture and Literature' is required, and we have both 'Mathematics' and 'Literature'.
Student 2 would also attend because 'Mathematics' and either 'Business' or 'Planetary Sciences' are required, and we have all of these.

By choosing these five subjects we have not only pleased the original four students who wanted 'Business', 'Computer Science', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Literature', but we've added three more for a total of seven students:

","We started checking the students’ preferences for the course. We aim to achieve the maximum amount of students. After some perspective, we came to realize that the course ""Global Languages"" is the one of the most frequently mentioned, connected with most of the other courses, and it’s a beneficial course that appears with both ""Planetary Sciences"" and ""Computer Science"" and ""Business"".

Student 7 will attend if either ""Planetary Sciences"" or ""Literature"" is offered along with ""Global Languages"".
Student 8 will attend if either ""Business"" or ""Computer Science"" is offered along with ""Global Languages"". 
So, ""Global Languages, ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Computer Science"" and ""Business"" can satisfy 2 students if we choose these four subjects. 

The remaining subject should be one, which will make one student attend but without decreasing the count of students decided above. If we selected ""Environmental Engineering"", Student 3 and Student 4 would join. However, if we pick ""Environmental Engineering"", we will lose Student 8 since he will not join without Government and Business. So picking ""Environmental Engineering"" won't increase the count. 

So, the remaining subject could be one of the remaining subjects related to the subjects mentioned before, and one of the subjects that a lot of the students' preferences depend on, e.g.: Mathematics, Literature or Supplemental Resources.

Let’s opt for ""Mathematics"", so we will also have student 1 in addition to student 7, student 5 and student 8, making it total of 5 students.

Students 1, 5, 7 and 8 will attend which means a total of 4 students will attend the classes which is, in this case, the maximum number of students that will attend.

","The school must choose 5 subjects that satisfy the conditions of as many students as possible. Looking at the statements of the students, we can see that the subject ""Business"" appears quite often. Also, the subject ""Literature"" and ""Computer Science"" appear quite regularly.

1. If the school offers ""Business"", it will satisfy the conditions for students 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
That's already 5 out of 10 students. However, we still got room for 4 more subjects.

2. If next ""Literature"" is offered, it will satisfy students 2 (if also ""Mechanical Engineering"" is offered), 4 (if also ""Planetary Sciences"" is offered), 6 (if also ""Mathematics"" is offered). So, offering this subject alone won't add any new students.

3. If next ""Computer Science"" is offered, it will satisfy students 2 (if also ""Mechanical Engineering"" is offered), 3, and 8. This will add 1 more student (student 3) which makes a total of 6 students. But the remaining two subjects must be carefully chosen to satisfy more students' condition.

4. As ""Planetary Sciences"" is desired by students 1 (if also ""Global Languages"" is offered) and 4 (if also ""Literature"" is offered), offering this subject is a good move as both students 1 and 4 conditions are already partially fulfilled. So by offering ""Planetary Sciences"", we cater to 2 more students: students 1 and 4. 

5. Now we are left with one last subject to offer. If we choose either ""Mathematics"" or ""Mechanical Engineering"", it will not add any new students as their paired conditions are not fulfilled. However, because ""Global Languages"" is a part of the conditions of student 1 (who will also attend if ""Planetary Sciences"" is offered which has been offered already), picking ""Global Languages"" will add one more student, number 1.

According to this analysis, offering ""Business"", ""Computer Science"", ""Literature"", ""Planetary Sciences"", and ""Global Languages"" will satisfy the conditions for 7 out of 10 students (students 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9).

","A careful analysis of all the students' statements reveals the following:

Students 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 have mentioned Literature in their respective statements. Of these, Student 1, 2, 4, and 7 will attend if Literature and any one of the other course they have mentioned is offered. Therefore, offering Literature will most likely draw more students.

Student 2, 8, and 9 have mentioned Architecture. Each student will attend if Architecture is offered with any other course on their list. Thus, offering Architecture will maximize attendance.

Student 3, 4, and 6 have mentioned Computer Science. Each of these students will attend if Computer Science is offered in conjunction with any one of the other courses they listed. Therefore, offering Computer Science will also maximize the student attendance.

Students 1, 5, 6, and 8 have mentioned Global Languages. Students 1 and 6 will attend if Global Languages and any other course they mentioned are combined together. Thus, offering Global Languages will increase the number of students attending the summer program.

Student 8 and 9 have mentioned Business and each of them will attend if this subject is combined with any other course mentioned on their list. Hence, offering Business will also increase the number of students in the summer program.

If we pick ['Literature', 'Architecture', 'Computer Science', 'Global Languages', 'Business'], the following students will attend: 

Student 1 (Literature, Global Languages), 
Student 2 (Literature, Architecture), 
Student 3 (Computer Science, Literature), 
Student 4 (Literature, Computer Science), 
Student 6 (Computer Science, Global Languages), 
Student 8 (Architecture, Business). 

Given these combinations, it is not possible to make more students attend the summer program.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Starting to solve this, let's break down questions into possible choices.

We can't choose 'Mechanical Engineering' because student 2 would also require either 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Mathematics', and no other students require those. This is not a valuable course to offer. 

We can't choose 'Literature' because only student 5 requires it and it would need to be paired with 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Architecture', and no other students mention those courses. 

Now let's check the remaining possibilities, which are:

- Student 1: Business with either Global Languages or Computer Science. (2 courses)
- Student 3: Computer Science with either Environmental Engineering or Business. (2 courses)
- Student 4: Computer Science with either Environmental Engineering or Mathematics. (2 courses)
- Student 6: Business with Global Languages or Supplemental Resources on its own. (2-3 courses)
- Student 7: Supplemental Resources with Environmental Engineering or Business on its own. (2-3 courses)
- Student 8: Planetary Sciences with Business or Global Languages on its own. (2-3 courses)
- Student 9: Planetary Sciences with Supplemental Resources or Literature on its own. (2-3 courses)
- Student 10: Environmental Engineering with either Architecture or Business. (2 courses)

To find the optimal solution we should try and repeat courses as much as possible.

After analysing the combinations, let's try to approach with most common subjects, which are 'Business' and 'Computer Science'. These cover 2 students (1 and 3 or 1 and 4).

Following that, we can see that 'Supplemental Resources' could satisfy either students 6 or 7 in combination with 'Business' so we should include 'Supplemental Resources' as our third subject, satisfying 3 students (1,3/4,6/7).

Next, 'Environmental Engineering' seems a good addition as it could be paired with 'Computer Science' for student 4, or with 'Supplemental Resources' for student 7. This makes 4 students happy (1, 3/4, 6/7, 4/7).

At this point we have the courses 'Business', 'Computer Science', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering' and are left with one more course to add. 

Adding 'Global Languages' as the fifth subject would allow student 1 to participate, but this student is already included in the attendees.

Therefore, the final course should be 'Planetary Sciences' to satisfy student 9, bringing the total number of satisfied students to 5 (1, 3/4, 6/7, 4/7, 9), which is the maximum that can be achieved.

","1. There are a total of 10 courses, the goal is to find the best 5 courses such that as many students as possible can attend.

3. We also need to see the paired courses with 'Architecture'. These are 'Business or Global Languages' from student 1, 'Environmental Engineering or Literature' from student 2, 'Planetary Sciences or Supplemental Resources' from student 7, 'Planetary Sciences or Computer Science' from student 8, 'Environmental Engineering' from student 9. 

4. So, if 'Architecture' is offered, to satisfy the conditions of students 1, 7, and 8, the best choice would be to offer 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Computer Science'. Adding these three courses would mean a total of 4 courses offered and would make 4 students attend.

5. For last course, 'Environmental Engineering' can be chosen because it is common between student 2 preference and student 9 preferece. By choosing 'Environmental Engineering' as fifth course, student 2 and student 9 would also attend the program.

By choosing these five courses, a total of six students (student 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and Mr. 3) would attend the program, which is the maximum that can be achieved under the given conditions.

6. Note that offering any other combination does not attract as many students. For example, if 'Mathematics' is offered instead of 'Business', it would bring along student 10, but student 1 would not take part, meaning 5 students would attend in total. Replacing 'Business' with 'Global Languages' would only keep 4 students in the scheme (students 1, 6, 7, and 8), hence it is not a better option. Also, offering 'Literature' instead of 'Environmental Engineering' makes total students attended five (1, 4, 7, 8, and 10). 

Therefore, the best course of action is choosing ['Architecture', 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Environmental Engineering'].

","This task involves a bit of logical reasoning rather a numerical solution. The school can only offer 5 subjects. To maximize the number of students attending, we need to satisfy the conditions of as many students as possible. Based on which subject or pair of subjects is most frequently asked, we select those subjects. 

The subject 'Planetary Sciences' has been mentioned by Students 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 which is the most any subject has been mentioned.

Also, 'Mathematics' has been mentioned by Students 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10.

So we should definitely offer those two subjects. Now we are left with 3 more subjects to offer.

The next frequently mentioned subject is 'Literature' mentioned by Students 2, 8, 9 and 10.

So, the third subject to offer will be 'Literature'. Now we are left with 2 more subjects to offer.

With these 3 subjects being offered, Student 2 and Student 8 would definitely attend. Student 1, 3, 5 and 7 would attend if we offer either 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Supplemental Resources' respectively along with the 3 subjects already being offered. 

The subject 'Architecture' is mentioned by Students 1 and 8, the subject 'Global Languages' is mentioned by Students 3 and 6, the subject 'Environmental Engineering' is mentioned by Student 5 and the subject 'Supplemental Resources' is mentioned by Students 4 and 7.

To bring in more students, it is logical to select 'Architecture' and 'Global Languages' which are mentioned by two students each as one of their choices. So, Student 1 and 3 would also attend.

Summing it up, with the five selected subjects, Students 1, 2, 3, and 8 would attend the program which is the maximum number of students that can be attending according to the conditions given.

","Looking over the student choices, the subject 'Architecture' comes up most. It is selected by 4 students, and thus should be part of the elective list. 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Environmental Engineering' comes up next with 3 students each picking them. 'Global Languages', 'Literature' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are picked by 2 students. 

Going further, the combination of 'Architecture' and 'Business' makes Student 1 attend. The combination of 'Architecture' and 'Planetary Sciences' makes Student 2 attend. The addition of 'Environmental Engineering' doesn't cater directly to any combination but it is part of 3 combinations along with 'Planetary Sciences' for two of them, thus it increases the chance that these courses combined together can attract more students.

Now, we have selected 4 out of 5 course and have been able to cater to two students, Student 1 and 2. For the 5th course, either 'Global Languages' or 'Mechanical Engineering' will make third student attend. However, since 'Global Languages' can potentially satisfy the requirements of Student 7 if we are able to offer 'Planetary Sciences' in future it should be chosen over 'Mechanical Engineering. 

The selected courses of 'Architecture', 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Global Languages' will encourage students 1, 2 and 5 to attend.

","Let's analyze the students' choices:

Student 1 needs either: Supplemental Resources and Literature, or Supplemental Resources and Architecture.

Student 2 needs either: Mechanical Engineering and Supplemental Resources, or Architecture alone.

Student 3 needs either: Architecture and Mechanical Engineering, or Architecture and Business. 

Student 4 needs either: Architecture and Business, or Environmental Engineering alone.

Student 5 needs either: Mechanical Engineering and Business, or Mechanical Engineering and Architecture. 

Student 6 needs either: Environmental Engineering and Global Languages, or Environmental Engineering and Business. 

Student 7 needs either: Business and Architecture, or Global Languages alone. 

Student 8 needs either: Architecture and Literature, or Architecture and Global Languages. 

Student 9 needs either: Business and Mechanical Engineering, or Supplemental Resources alone. 

Student 10 needs either: Environmental Engineering and Supplemental Resources, or Mathematics alone.

To satisfy as many students as possible, we need to consider that some subjects are more frequently chosen and more often paired together. 

For example, Architecture is a common subject among 7 students (1,2,3,4,5,7,8), Business is chosen by 5 students (3,4,5,6,7), and Mechanical Engineering is selected by 3 students (2,3,5).

Based on this analysis, if the school offers Architecture, Business, Mechanical Engineering, Supplemental Resources, and Global Languages it will cover the preferences of 6 students (2,3,4,5,7,9), which is the maximum number of students we can satisfy with 5 subjects.

","In order to solve this problem, we need to analyze the preferences of all students. We should focus on courses which were highly demanded by multiple students because we can only offer 5 subjects. 

Based on the students preferences, the main subjects that can reach the most students are:

1. 'Mechanical Engineering' is required by Student 1, Student 2, and Student 9.
2. 'Planetary Sciences' is required by Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4.
3. 'Literature' is required by Student 2, Student 5 and Student 8.
4. 'Computer Science' is required by Student 6, Student 7, Student 9, and Student 10.
5. 'Supplemental Resources' is required by Student 3, Student 7, and Student 10.

Other subjects such as Business, Mathematics, Architecture, Global Languages and Environmental Engineering are mentioned by the fewer number of students.

So, let's choose 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature', 'Computer Science' and 'Supplemental Resources'. 

This selection of classes will appeal to Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 7, Student 9 and Student 10, so 6 students will attend the program.

If we were to substitute any other subject, it would decrease the number of students who would attend. Therefore, it is the combination that maximizes attendance.

","Step 1: We look for a combination of subjects that would attract the most number of students. It will be beneficial to include subject, which covers the possibilities given by a significant number of students.

Step 2: We realize ""Computer Science"" is a common element in the statements made by the Students 1, 2, 4, 5, 8. By offering this subject, the school could appeal to many students.

Step 3: We then examine the logical statements made by the students. One of the clauses in each of them says that the combination of two subjects will also attract them - like ""Literature and (Computer Science or Supplemental Resources)"" - this depicts that in the case that Literature and either Computer Science or Supplemental Resources is taken then the student would attend.

Step 4: We consider accommodating more students by analysing these sorts of combinations in students’ choices, the first part of Student 5's & 7’s statement includes 'Supplemental Resources' increasing the count of attendees if it is offered. 

Step 5: By adding Mathematics, we manage to cover the choices of two more students (Student 3, 6,) as it is part of their requirements, bringing the total up to 7 attendees. 

Step 6: For the 5th subject, we have a few options. But choosing ‘Global Languages’ would satisfy either part of 2 student's demand (Student 2 and 7), hence making it the best option.

So if the school were to offer Computer Science, Supplemental Resources, Mathematics, Literature, and Global Languages it would attract the maximum number of students.

","First, it is essential to simplify every option for each student to understand their preferences easier. 

Student 1: [Environmental Engineering, [Mechanical Engineering, Supplemental Resources]]
Student 2: [Supplemental Resources, [Planetary Sciences, Architecture]]
Student 3: [Computer Science, [Environmental Engineering, Mathematics]]
Student 4: [Architecture, [Mathematics, Literature]]
Student 5: [[Computer Science & Mathematics], Environmental Engineering]
Student 6 [[Supplemental Resources & Mechanical Engineering], Planetary Sciences]
Student 7: [Architecture, [Planetary Sciences, Environmental Engineering]]
Student 8: [[Global Languages & Computer Science], Architecture]
Student 9: [[Business & Planetary Sciences], Global Languages]
Student 10: [[Mechanical Engineering & Mathematics], Computer Science]

The goal is to accommodate as many students as possible, which means looking for overlaps in courses. From my observation, common course subjects that the students want are 'Computer Science,' 'Supplemental Resources,' 'Environmental Engineering,' 'Architecture,' and 'Mathematics.' These subjects reflected in the preferences of 4, 2, 3, 3, and 3 students, respectively. Thus, let's analyze the scenario if these subjects are offered.

If 'Computer Science,' 'Supplemental Resources,' 'Environmental Engineering,' 'Architecture,' and 'Mathematics' are offered, let's find out which students will attend. 

Student 1: This student will attend because 'Environmental Engineering' is offered.
Student 2: This student will not attend because 'Planetary Sciences' is not offered.
Student 3: This student will attend because 'Computer Science,' 'Environmental Engineering,' and 'Mathematics' are offered.
Student 4: This student will attend because 'Architecture' and 'Mathematics' are offered.
Student 5: This student will attend because 'Computer Science,' 'Mathematics', and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered.
Student 6: This student will not attend because 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are not offered.
Student 7: This student will attend because 'Architecture' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered.
Student 8: This student will attend because 'Computer Science' and 'Architecture' are offered.
Student 9: This student will not attend because 'Business' and 'Planetary Sciences' are not offered.
Student 10: This student will not attend because 'Mechanical Engineering' is not offered.

After evaluating these combinations, it shows that seven students will attend, and three students will not, which means 70% of the students gave assent to these subjects. Given that the school can only offer five subjects, this combination of courses gives the maximum possible attendance.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","This problem can be approached by looking for courses that appear most frequently in students' requirements. 

Let's first examine the classes that get mentioned by the most students:

- Mathematics (mentioned by students 1, 6, 10)
- Supplemental Resources (mentioned by students 1, 2, 4, 7)
- Literature (mentioned by students 1, 5, 6, 7)
- Mechanical Engineering (mentioned by students 2, 3, 9, 10)
- Global Language (mentioned by students 2, 3, 8, 10)
- Computer Science (mentioned by students 4, 8, 9)
- Environmental Engineering (mentioned by students 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Planetary Sciences (mentioned by students 4, 5, 6)

From this, we can determine that 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Language', and 'Mathematics' are each mentioned by four students. This is the highest number of mentions.

We include these five courses in the program, thereby ensuring that potentially four students will attend. The selection would then attract the following students:

- Mathematics and Supplemental Resources (Student 1)
- Supplemental Resources or Mechanical Engineering (Student 2)
- Mechanical Engineering and Global Languages (Student 10)
- Literature (an individual course) attracts none as all students require Literature with at least one other course out of our selected five.

Remember, each student has a 'if and only if' condition. If at least one of their conditions fails, they will not attend. Therefore, we may be able to get more than four students if we massage our selection a bit.

Let's try swapping Mathematics with Environmental Engineering. Now we get:

- Supplemental Resources and Environmental Engineering (Student 7)
- Literature and Supplemental Resources (Student 7)
- Supplemental Resources or Mechanical Engineering (Student 2)

This means that with this selection, we can attract at least three students (2,7).

Combinations can be tried out with the most mentioned subjects to see if more students can attend, but in this case, we have considered the pairing that can get more students than others. Therefore, the subjects: 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Language', 'Environmental Engineering' can potentially incentivize the maximum number of students to attend.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","Step 1: Check the most frequently mentioned subjects
By skimming through the students' statements quickly, it seems that 'Global Languages',  'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering' are mentioned quite frequently.

Step 2: Select three of the most frequently mentioned subjects that are also tied to the rest
'Mathematics' and 'Mechanical Engineering', for example, do not link to any other subject besides 'Business'. By focusing on 'Global Languages', 'Computer Science', and 'Business', they can each be paired with another subject, creating more combination possibilities.

Step 3: Select last two subjects to accommodate maximum students
Now, we have 2 course options left that we can use to get as many students as possible to attend.  Looking closely, 'Literature' can satisfy both student 2 and 5, while 'Mechanical Engineering' can satisfy both student 1 and student 8. 

Following above steps, the five subjects will make these students attend: 

-Student 1: As 'Business' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are both offered.
-Student 2: 'Business' and 'Literature' are offered, that satisfies this student's criteria.
-Student 3: This student's option is not fulfilled by the selected courses, won't be attending.
-Student 4: Only 'Global Languages' is offered, but 'Architecture' or 'Environmental Engineering' are not, so this student won't be attending.
-Student 5: Will attend, as 'Computer Science' and 'Literature' are both offered.
-Student 6: 'Computer Science' is offered but 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Supplemental Resources' are not, so this student won't be attending.
-Student 7: 'Computer Science' is offered but 'Global Languages' or 'Mechanical Engineering' are not both offered, so this student won't be attending.
-Student 8: Will be attending as 'Global Languages' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered.
-Student 9: Only 'Global Languages' is offered, but 'Mathematics' or 'Literature' are not both, so this student won't be attending.
-Student 10: Will be attending as 'Computer Science' and 'Business' are both offered.

In conclusion, 'Global Languages', 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering' are the five courses that should be offered in order to maximize the number of attendees. A total of 5 students would attend.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","The difficulty in this task lies in the limitation of the school only being able to offer exactly 5 subjects. It's impossible to satisfy every student's preferences, so we must attempt to pick the 5 subjects that will appease as many students as possible.

We first need to consider the subjects that seem to be mentioned the most by the students:

1. Computer Science is mentioned by students 1, 4, 5, 6.
2. Mathematics is mentioned by students 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.
3. Business is mentioned by students 3, 7, 9.
4. Planetary Sciences is mentioned by students 1, 2, 10.
5. Supplemental Resources is also mentioned by students 1, 8, 10.

Right there, we can see that Mathematics and Computer Science are preferred subjects, with 5 and 4 mentions respectively. If we choose these two subjects, we would potentially attract students 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 - leaving only students 2, 3, and 9 unsatisfied.

To count the 3rd, 4th and 5th subjects to offer, we need to revisit each statement and check which subjects, when combined with Mathematics and Computer Science, could attract more students.

By looking again at the subjects mentioned by the selected students:

- Students 1 and 10: would also need Planetary Sciences or Supplemental Resources.
- Students 6 and 7: would also need Business or Global Languages or Mechanical Engineering.
- Student 4: needs Literature or Mechanical Engineering.
- Student 5: needs Mechanical Engineering or else has already been satisfied by Computer Science and Mathematics.
- Student 8: needs Supplemental Resources.

So, the third subject we should put on offer would be Mechanical Engineering because it could potentially attract 4 more students (4, 5, 6, 7). 

The 4th and 5th subjects should be Planetary Sciences and Supplemental Resources because they each are mentioned by three unique students who have not been completely satisfied yet. This way we can satisfy as many students as possible.

","The goal here is to determine the five classes that will satisfy the most students' conditions so that they will attend the program. 

1. Student 1: Choices are Computer Science, Architecture, Environmental Engineering
2. Student 2: Choices are Architecture, Supplemental Resources, Literature
3. Student 3: Choices are Global Languages, Environmental Engineering, Computer Science
4. Student 4: Choices are Mathematics, Planetary Sciences, Architecture
5. Student 5: Choices are Business, Supplemental Resources, Literature
6. Student 6: Choices are Environmental Engineering, Mathematics, Planetary Sciences
7. Student 7: Choices are Planetary Sciences, Mathematics, Global Languages
8. Student 8: Choices are Mathematics, Global Languages, Architecture
9. Student 9: Choices are Planetary Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering
10. Student 10: Choices are Literature, Global Languages, Mechanical Engineering

Analyzing these statements, it seems 'Architecture,' 'Planetary Sciences,' 'Mathematics,' 'Environmental Engineering,' and 'Literature' appear most frequently in the students' choices. However, we can't just pick the most frequent subjects, because some of them always appear together in the student's choices (and therefore can't be separated). 

From the above analysis, we need to consider that 'Architecture' attracts students 1,2, and 4. Also Architecture never appears with another subject in their choices, so this should be one of the courses. 

'Mathematics', appears with Students 4, 6, 7 and 8, and would attract 4 students if offered. 

'Environmental Engineering' is chosen by students 1, 3, 6 and 9, and would attract these students if offered.

'Literature' attracts students 2, 5 and 10. However, for students 2 and 5, 'Literature' must be offered with 'Architecture' or 'Business', respectively, in order to attract them. Considering 'Architecture' is already selected, 'Literature' would only attract students 2 and 10. 

'Planetary Sciences' attracts students 4, 6, 7 and 9, but for 6 and 9 it must be offered with 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Environmental Engineering' is already selected. Therefore, if offered, it would attract students 4, 7, and potentially 6 and 9 if we choose 'Environmental Engineering.'

The last slot could be considered for 'Global Languages', which attracts students 3, 7, 8, and 10, and it doesn't require any linked subject. 

After the analysis, the courses to offer would be 'Architecture', 'Mathematics', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Global languages', which would attract a maximum of 11 students (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, potentially 10). 

Other combinations could attract the same number of students, but this combination was chosen as it covers a broad range of disciplines.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","Step 1: 
Identify which subjects are most frequently requested. 

We can see the following frequencies are:

- 'Computer Science' is required by 3 students (#2, #5, #7).
- 'Business' is required by 3 students (#5, #6, #7, #9).
- 'Mathematics' is required by 2 students (#7, #10).
- 'Mechanical Engineering' is required by 3 students (#1, #2, #9).
- 'Literature' is required by 2 students (#3, #4, #8).
- 'Architecture' is required by 1 student (#3).
- 'Global Languages' is required by 2 students (#4, #6).
- 'Supplemental Resources' is required by 2 students (#5, #6, #10).
- 'Planetary Sciences' is required by 3 students (#1, #3, #8, #10).
- 'Environmental Engineering' is required by 4 students (#1, #2, #4, #9).

Step 2:
Choose the top 5 common subjects:

- 'Computer Science'
- 'Business'
- 'Mechanical Engineering'
- 'Planetary Sciences'
- 'Environmental Engineering'

Step 3: 
On choosing these five subjects, note that:

- Student 1 will attend if 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Planetary Sciences' are offered.
- Student 2 will attend if 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Computer Science' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered.
- Student 5 will attend if 'Business' and 'Computer Science' are offered.
- Student 7 will attend if 'Computer Science' and 'Business' are offered.
- Student 9 will attend if 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Business' is offered.

Therefore, this choice of subjects ensures that 5 students attend. It is not possible to make more students attend because other subjects are required by fewer students, swapping them into the chosen subjects will not increase the number of students attending.

","Step 1:
Firstly, it is observed that every student requires either two or three classes to be content with attending the classes. Therefore, more than one student will never be content with the same pair of classes as all their pairs are different. This immediately tells us that it is impossible to make more than 5 students to attend.

Step 2:
An important fact to observe is that no exact pair of classes is demanded by two different students. This suggests that all students are unique in their desired pair of classes. Now again, since every student needs two classes to attend, at most we can satisfy 5/2 = 2.5 ≈ 2 students. So it is impossible to have everyone attending. 

Step 3:
Given the constraints, the best strategy would be to find three classes that appear frequently in the students' preferences and make those classes available.

From reading the students' preferences, it appears that 'Business' appears 4 times, 'Planetary Sciences' appears 3 times, 'Mechanical Engineering' appears 2 times, 'Literature' appears 3 times, 'Computer Science' appears 3 times, 'Supplemental Resources' appears twice and 'Architecture' appears 3 times. 

It may initially seem that by providing 'Business', 'Planetary Sciences', and 'Literature', 'Computer Science', and 'Architecture', we can gather the most students, but due to how individual students have grouped their class preferences, this may not hold true.

Step 4:
To maximize the number of students:
We include 'Business', as it is the most frequently appearing class in the students' preferences. We also notice that 'Business' is coupled with 'Mechanical Engineering' by students 1 and 7, so by including 'Mechanical Engineering', we can ensure these two students will attend.
Payload addition of 'Business' and 'Mechanical Engineering' will have two students attending.

Step 5:
Next, we notice that 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Literature' are demanded by 3 students (students 2, 4, 10 for 'Planetary Sciences' and students 2, 4, 6 for 'Literature'). 
By including 'Literature', we can ensure student 2 will attend as one of his conditions, 'Computer Science or Planetary Sciences' is already fulfilled by 'Planetary Sciences'. So, the addition of 'Literature' results in one more student attending.

Step 6:
For the last two subjects, we must carefully try to satisfy as many students as possible by covering unique subjects. Since 'Computer Science' appears 3 times (students 2, 6, 9), 'Supplemental Resources' (students 1, 3), 'Architecture' (students 5, 6, 8) we can include any two of these and it will attract one more student inspite of their combinations.
For instance, if we choose 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Architecture', this will satisfy student 6.

So, by offering 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', the school can have 5 students attend, which is the maximum possible given the classes and student preferences.

","After analyzing the students' statements, it becomes clear that Environmental Engineering and Mathematics are the most popular subjects with 5 mentions each. Following them, Literature, Business and Computer Science each have 4 interests; Mechanical Engineering has 3 interests; and Planetary Sciences has 2 interests. Architecture, Global Languages, and Supplemental Resources each only got mentioned once. Moreover, no student indicated a preference for Global Languages, thus this subject is least preferred and does not need to be considered.

To make the most students attend, we should select the 5 subjects most often mentioned in the students' requirements. However, count of mentions is not the only factor; we must also consider the conditional nature of the statements. Some students only desire one subject if another is also on offer. So, we have to choose the subjects that satisfy the largest number of students' specific conditions.

Listing out the conditions in which Mathematics and Environmental Engineering appear, it seems that selecting Literature and Computer Science would satisfy the most conditions in combination with those two subjects. In addition, we see that Mechanical Engineering is also in high demand, and would cover most students' requests when combined with these four subjects.

Offering 'Mathematics', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', and 'Mechanical Engineering' would lead to the following students attending: Student 1, Student 3, Student 4, Student 5, Student 7, Student 8, and Student 10, thus a total of 7 students.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","First, let's analyze the students' preferences.
Most of the students have 2 specific subjects in common that they would like to see offered. The rest either contain a choice between two additional subjects or another subject as a third choice.

Student 1, 3, 4, and 8 emphasized the importance of 'Supplemental Resources'. 
Student 2, 5, 6 and 8 emphasized the importance of 'Architecture'. 
'Supplemental Resources' and 'Architecture' is the preference for a large number of students and therefore should be included in the offered courses.

Next, let's look at the additional subject pairs: 
- Student 1: 'Mathematics' or 'Mechanical Engineering'.
- Student 2: 'Literature' or 'Environmental Engineering'.
- Student 3: 'Computer Science'
- Student 4: 'Global Languages'
- Student 5: 'Computer Science' or 'Business'.
- Student 6: 'Computer Science' or 'Global Languages'.
- Student 7: 'Mathematics' and ('Global Languages' or 'Literature').
- Student 8: 'Environmental Engineering'
- Student 9: 'Mathematics' and 'Literature' or 'Global Languages'
- Student 10: 'Mathematics' and ('Environmental Engineering' or 'Computer Science').

Among the remaining available subjects, 'Computer Science' appears most frequently - 4 times, followed by 'Mathematics' - 3 times, 'Environmental Engineering' - 2 times, 'Global Languages' - 2 times, and 'Literature' - 2 times. 

Let's start by adding 'Computer Science' to our course offers. At this point, we've already captured the interest of Student 3, Student 5 and Student 6 (as 'Architecture' is also being offered). That's 3 students already.

Next, we add 'Mathematics' to our offered courses. Now, Student 1 (as 'Supplemental Resources' is also being offered) and Student 10 (as 'Computer Science' is being offered) are also interested. This is a total of 5 students: Student 1, 3, 5, 6 and 10.

We have one more course to add. The addition of 'Global Languages' will attract Student 4 and 7. The addition of 'Environmental Engineering' will attract Student 2. Both options allow us to attract a total of 7 students. 

We can choose any of these two subjects since they both attract the same amount of students. For this analysis, we'll add 'Global Languages'. 

In conclusion, with the selection of these five subjects, 7 out of 10 students will attend:

1) 'Supplemental Resources'
2) 'Architecture'
3) 'Computer Science'
4) 'Mathematics'
5) 'Global Languages'

Attending students: Student 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.

","Looking at the courses chosen by the students, it is clear that certain subjects like ""Mathematics"", ""Architecture"", ""Literature"", ""Supplemental Resources"", and ""Environmental Engineering"" are more popular than the others. However, we are limited to only choosing 5 subjects and we are trying to maximize the number of students that will attend.

The selection strategy here would be composing the most requested subjects along with optional ones in a way that better fits a larger number of students. However, one should note that there is no possible selection which satisfies all students' preferences.

Student 1: Environmental Engineering and (Mathematics or Business)
Student 2: Mechanical Engineering and (Supplemental Resources or Literature)
Student 3: (Architecture and Mathematics) or Planetary Sciences
Student 4: (Literature and Mathematics) or Business
Student 5: Supplemental Resources and (Planetary Sciences or Computer Science)
Student 6: Architecture and (Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering)
Student 7: Architecture and (Planetary Sciences or Supplemental Resources)
Student 8: Environmental Engineering and (Global Languages or Literature)
Student 9: (Architecture and Supplemental Resources) or Computer Science
Student 10: Literature and (Global Languages or Mechanical Engineering)

Focusing on the first part of students' requirements, three courses that are majorly offered are: ""Environmental Engineering"", ""Architecture"" and ""Literature"". We still have two slots left. 

Let's choose ""Mathematics"" and ""Supplemental Resources"". The reason for choosing these are because ""Mathematics"" comes in the choices of 3 students (1, 3, 4, and 6) and ""Supplemental Resources"" is a choice for 2 other students (2, 5, and 9).

So, by offering these 5 subjects, we can satisfy: Student 1, Student 3, Student 4, Student 5 , Student 6 and Student 9. This solution will allow 6 out of 10 students to attend, which makes it the approach with the highest number of students attending. Any other combination will result in fewer students attending.

","Determining which subjects to offer can be done by analyzing the subjects that most students want. It's like solving a puzzle where some pieces (subjects) seem to fit in more places (student's statements) than others. Here's a walk-through of an approach that could find a solution:

- Step 1: Identify the most recurring subjects in the students' statements. By studying each student's condition, we can see that 'Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', and 'Computer Science' are mentioned by quite a number of the students.

- Step 2: Make a selection of suitable subjects. Considering the most recurring subjects identified in Step 1, we can select the first five subjects: ['Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering'].

- Step 3: Verify the selection by checking how many students will attend if these subjects are offered. Details of the students who will attend are mentioned below:
  - Student 1 will attend because 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered.
  - Student 2 will attend because 'Literature' and 'Supplemental Resources' are offered.
  - Student 3 will attend because 'Business' and 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered.
  - Student 4 will not attend because though 'Literature' is offered, neither 'Computer Science' nor 'Mechanical Engineering' are offered.
  - Student 8 will not attend because though 'Mechanical Engineering' is offered, neither 'Architecture' nor 'Supplemental Resources' is offered.  
  - Only 3 out of 10 students will attend. Let's check if there is a better choice.

- Step 4: Fine-tune the classes to maximize attendance. If we replace 'Business' with 'Computer Science', we will cover more students' preferences. Our subjects will be: ['Supplemental Resources', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Literature', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computer Science']

- Step 5: Repeat the verification from Step 3. The students who will attend are:
  - Student 1 will attend because 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered.
  - Student 2 will attend because 'Literature' and 'Supplemental Resources' are offered.
  - Student 4 will attend because 'Literature' and 'Computer Science' are offered.
  - Student 6 will attend because 'Computer Science' and 'Environmental Engineering' are offered.
  - Student 8 will not attend because though 'Mechanical Engineering' is offered, neither 'Architecture' nor 'Supplemental Resources' are offered.
  - 5 out of 10 students will attend, which is the best we can do given the constraints.

A detail to note here is that since we can only offer 5 subjects, it becomes increasingly difficult to accommodate more students since more unique subject combinations appear as we progress down the list of students.

Every possible combination of 5 subjects will always exclude few students because of the unique subject pairings or triplets they wish to study. By switching subjects from the original selection of most recurring ones, it is possible to slightly increase the number of students attending the program. 

Therefore, the optimum choice of subjects to offer, ensuring highest possible attendance would be:

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","Step 1:
To maximize student attendance, let's start by counting how many students would like certain modules to be offered. 

Computer Science - 4 students are interested
Business - 4 students are interested
Mathematics - 4 students are interested,
Supplemental Resources - 3 students are interested,
Mechanical Engineering - 4 students are interested,
Literature - 4 students are interested,
Architecture - 1 student is interested,
Global Languages - 1 student is interested,
Planetary Sciences - 2 students are interested,
Environmental Engineering - 0 students are interested.

Step 2:
Given the restrictions (max of 5 subjects to be offered), we will start by limiting our selection to the subjects with 3 or more students showing interest, which are: Computer Science, Business, Mathematics, Supplemental Resources, Mechanical Engineering, Literature.

Step 3:
Now we need to find a combination of 5 subjects from the selected ones that allows as many students as possible to attend the programme. After reading the statements and looking at the popular subjects, it seems like the majority of the students are interested in taking 'Computer Science' and it seems like a good fit for the most of the conditions.

Step 4:
The next step would be to look for subjects in combination with 'Computer Science'. 'Mechanical Engineering,' 'Supplemental Resources,' and 'Business' stand out. Offering these three courses along with 'Computer Science' will allow students 2, 4, 6, and 7 to attend the summer program. 

Step 5:
Now, we have one spot left. 'Mathematics' and 'Literature' are the remaining most popular choices. If we decide to offer 'Mathematics', it will allow student 5 to attend. Offering 'Literature' will lead to no increase in students. Thus, 'Mathematics' is the last subject that should be offered. 

Offering the courses 'Computer Science,' 'Mechanical Engineering,' 'Supplemental Resources,' 'Business' and 'Mathematics' will allow us to attract the maximum number of students, i.e., 5 out of 10.

Your task is: Which 5 subjects should the school offer such that as many students as possible will attend?

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","First, to see who you can satisfy with which subjects, note down what courses interest each student:

1. Global Languages, Literature, Planetary Sciences
2. Mechanical Engineering, Supplemental Resources, Planetary Sciences
3. Planetary Sciences, Architecture, Global Languages
4. Business, Planetary Sciences, Supplemental Resources
5. Supplemental Resources, Computer Science, Literature
6. Planetary Sciences, Mathematics, Business
7. Architecture, Environmental Engineering, Planetary Sciences
8. Mechanical Engineering, Global Languages, Supplemental Resources
9. Mathematics, Computer Science, Architecture
10. Architecture, Literature, Computer Science

Looking at the courses, 'Planetary Sciences' appears as the favorite subject for most of the students, specifically, students 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. So, this should be one of the courses to be offered.

Now, we look for other popular courses that may not conflict. 'Supplemental Resources' is requested by students 2, 4, 5, and 8. 'Architecture' is requested by students 3, 7, 9, and 10. 'Business' is requested by students 4, and 6. Finally,'Literature' is requested by students 1, and 5.

If we look at the course choices of students 2 and 8, 'Mechanical Engineering' is a common interest. Also, the course 'Global Languages' is a common interest of students 1 and 8. However, adding these courses won't bring in new students as all their other courses of interest are covered in our list.

On the other hand, if we consider 'Computer Science', it is a common interest of students 5, 9, and 10. Adding this course would definitely bring these students in.

So, the five courses the school should offer are: 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Business', and 'Computer Science'. 

OFFERED COURSES: ['Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Architecture', 'Business', 'Computer Science'] 

Using this combination, the school can get maximum participation—students 1, 3, 5, and 6 will definitely attend. Students 2 and 4 may attend, depending on their preference for Supplemental Resources. Students 7, 9, and 10 may attend, depending on their preference for Architecture or Computer Science. This set of courses gives a possibility of 7 students attending, which is more than any other combination.",,0.9703557312252964

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","We can solve this problem by analyzing and comparing statement requirements and trying to find the combination that satisfies as many students as possible.

If we look closely, 'Business' is a course that is frequently demanded by many students (Student 1, Student 3, Student 4, Student 6, and Student 10). So, let's include 'Business' in our subject list because it would potentially attract several students. 

1 subject: ['Business']

To satisfy more students, 'Planetary Sciences' can be included as it is in the options of student 3, 4 and 6. Also, 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Business' together can make student 3 & 4 attend the school. 

2 subjects: ['Business', 'Planetary Sciences']

Next, let's consider 'Supplemental Resources'. This subject is favored by student 2 and student 8. Including this subject will guarantee at least Student 2's attendance and also opens up potential coverage for others. 

3 subjects: ['Business', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources']

Adding 'Literature' will not only satisfy Student 1 (as we already have Business) but also Student 2 (as we already have Supplemental Resources).

4 subjects: ['Business', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature']

The last subject can be 'Mathematics' because it is mentioned by a number of students: Student 4, Student 5, and Student 7. Although it won't guarantee their attendance (because they have other subject requirements as well), it will increase the chance that these students might join. 

5 subjects: ['Business', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Mathematics']

This strategy guarantees that Students 1, 2, 3, and 4 will attend. Students 5 to 10 also have some of their conditions met, hence they might also choose to attend, but their attendance is not guaranteed.

There does not seem to be a possibility of choosing courses in a way to guarantee more students, as these students have specified combinations of subjects and the school can only offer exactly 5.

","Since there are a lot of options and conditions, it seems best to select a subset of subjects which is mentioned the most by students.

We also need to keep in mind that we have conditions where we can select one of the subjects mentioned, hence prioritizing such subjects might yield better results.

Upon a manual count, we see that ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Global Languages"" has the maximum weightage and ""Business"" and ""Mathematics"" comes in second with ""Literature"" and ""Computer Science"" being supportive subjects.

Trying to maximize the number of students attending, we should start by selecting ""Environmental Engineering"" and ""Global Languages"". This provides the basis for Student 1, Student 2, and Student 6.

Adding ""Literature"" provides the attending condition for Student 2 and Student 4.

Adding ""Business"" provides the attending condition for Student 1 and Student 5.

Adding ""Computer Science"" adds Student 4 and Student 6.

Therefore, the courses offered should be [[""Environmental Engineering"", ""Global Languages"", ""Business"", ""Literature"" and ""Computer Science""]] 

With this selection, Student 1, Student 2, Student 4, Student 5, and Student 6 are able to attend making the total of attending students = 5. It's not possible to make more students attend because adding or removing any course would decrease the total count.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","To maximize the number of students who will attend, the school needs to offer subjects that are demanded by the most students.

To start with, let's find the subjects that are most commonly mentioned:

1. 'Supplemental Resources' is mentioned by Student 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10. Thus, it's reasonable to include 'Supplemental Resources' in our course offerings.

2. 'Business' is mentioned by Student 1, 4, 5, 9. So, 'Business' is our next choice.

3. 'Architecture' is the next most commonly mentioned subject by Student 3, 5, 9. So we add 'Architecture' to our course offerings.

4. 'Global Languages' is mentioned by Student 2, 7, 10. So, we also include 'Global Languages' in our courses.

5. For the fifth subject, we have more options including Planetary Sciences, Computer Science, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Literature, Environmental Engineering, but we can choose only one. Let's consider 'Planetary Sciences', as it is mentioned by Student 1 and 8. 

This course selection would allow the most students to take the summer course.

Here are the students who will attend with our course selection and why:

- Student 1 will attend because Supplemental Resources and Business are offered.
- Student 2 will attend because Supplemental Resources is offered.
- Student 3 will attend because Architecture and Supplemental Resources are offered.
- Student 4 will attend because Supplemental Resources is offered.
- Student 5 will attend because Architecture and Business are offered.
- Student 7 will attend because Global Languages and Supplemental Resources are offered.
- Student 10 will attend because Supplemental Resources and Global Languages are offered.

Since we can offer exactly 5 subjects, we can't make more students attend as they have other preferences which either requires more courses to be offered or different courses.

","Since the school can only offer 5 subjects, we need to try to find a common combination of subjects that would appeal to as many students as possible. Let's look into the statements made by each student.

On the first look itself, we can see that Mathematics, Computer Science, and Global Languages are some subjects that many of the students have expressed interest in 

Manually examining the 10 demands, looking for overlap and using a bit of trial and error, we find that a combination that meets many of the students' criteria is:

1. Mathematics
2. Global Languages
3. Business
4. Environmental Engineering
5. Architecture

Let's do a rundown:

Student 1: Mathematics is offered. Student will attend.

Student 2: Architecture, Environmental Engineering, and Global Languages are offered. Student will attend.

Student 3: Global Languages and Architecture are offered. Student will attend.

Student 4: Mathematics and Global Languages are offered. Student will attend.

Student 5: Business and Global Languages are offered. Student will attend.

Student 6: Mathematics is offered. Student will attend.

Student 7: Business is offered. Student will attend.

Student 8: Environmental Engineering and Business are offered. Student will attend.

Student 9: Environmental Engineering and Architecture are offered. Student will attend.

Student 10: Mathematics is offered. Student will attend.

Therefore with the above subjects all 10 students will attend.

Due to the constraints of the problem and the conditions stated by the students, it is not possible to make more students attend.

For example, the last line might look like this:
OFFERED COURSES: ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature']
","To solve this, we need to choose 5 courses which will cover the preferences of as many students as possible. To do this we'll take a look at the most popular courses across the students' preferences.

By scanning through the students' preferences, three courses stand out due to their repetition in the preferences: Business, Supplemental Resources, and Mechanical Engineering, appearing in 5, 3, and 3 students' statements respectively. 

Consequently, we can start by making sure to include these three courses in our offered courses. 
This will potentially allow 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 students to participate depending on the other two courses offered. However, we need to consider that some students depend on two distinct pairings such as 'Mechanical Engineering or Global Languages' and one might not agree with the other.

On careful inspection, we note that several students require a pairing of a selected course and another course: 

- Student 1, 6 and 8 want 'Business and Supplemental Resources'.
- Student 3 wants 'Mechanical Engineering and Global Languages'.
- Student 4 wants 'Mechanical Engineering and Business'.
- Student 9 wants 'Mechanical Engineering or Business'.

While it's immediately appealing to include 'Global Languages' as one of the final two courses to get 3 students to attend, doing so would raise a conflict with the course pairings involving 'Mechanical Engineering' (Students 3 and 4). Hence, a better approach would be to pick 'Business' as the next course since it meets the requirements of more students (Students 4 and 9).

Finally, for the fifth course, we can either offer 'Literature' (for Student 1 and 5) or 'Computer Science' (for Student 6 and 7). As we cannot prioritize one set of students over the other, we may choose either.

Therefore, the courses should be:

""Computer Science"", ""Architecture"", and ""Planetary Sciences"" seem to be the popular choices among students as they appear in the conditions from multiple students. ""Mechanical Engineering"" also shows up quite a few times. 

If we choose ""Computer Science"", ""Architecture"", ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Mechanical Engineering"" and for the fifth subject, we have to choose one that belongs to one or more students' second brackets considering the two subjects already chosen, for this reason, ""Literature"" looks like a good choice because is a subject on the second brackets of students 2, 9, and 10.

With these subjects, Students 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 should be able to attend, as their conditions would be met which means a total 8 students.

","Looking at the students' preferences, it can be noticed that there are some subjects that are needed by more than one student. 'Mathematics', 'Architecture', and 'Business' appear frequently in the students' requirements.

Let's choose 'Mathematics' and 'Architecture' as two of the offered subjects. Offering these two would satisfy part of the requirements of the five students 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Ideally, we should choose the remaining subjects such that they also satisfy the conditions for the other students as well. 

Choosing 'Business' as the third subject will allow two more students (Students 1 and 6) to join because their condition only misses one more course - 'Business'. So, we have secured three students thus far and we have two subjects left to offer.

Since we can offer two more subjects, it is a good idea to see if adding a pair of subjects would satisfy any of the remaining students. 

Watching their preferences, 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Computer Science' can be chosen to satisfy two more students (Students 3 and 4). This is because Student 3 will attend if either 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Mathematics' or 'Architecture' is offered, and since we are already offering 'Mathematics' and 'Architecture', offering 'Environmental Engineering' will fulfill their conditions. Similarly for Student 4, offering 'Computer Science' completes their requirement since they had expressed 'Mathematics' and 'Computer Science' or 'Mechanical Engineering', and 'Mathematics' was among the first offers.
Now, the students who will attend are Students 1, 3, 4 and 6.

Other students can't attend because their required courses are not among our choices, and it's not possible to include more students with a different set of five classes as offering 'Architecture', 'Mathematics', 'Business', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Computer Science' maximises the number of students attending.

","To solve this problem, we need to optimize the number of students who would be attracted to attend the summer program. It's important to notice that the conditions for attending the classes can be complex; some students have ""or"" conditions which means they would be satisfied with one of the subjects being offered, while others have ""and"" conditions which means they require both subjects to be offered. 

Let's analyze the opinions and come up with a decision that satisfies the criteria of most students.

Student 1: Literature, [Business or Supplemental Resources]
Student 2: [Supplemental Resources and Literature] or Business
Student 3: [Planetary Sciences and Environmental Engineering] or Mechanical Engineering
Student 4: Computer Science, [Literature or Global Languages]
Student 5: Computer Science, [Global Languages or Architecture]
Student 6: [Supplemental Resources and Planetary Sciences] or Global Languages
Student 7: Computer Science, [Literature or Mechanical Engineering]
Student 8: Business, [Supplemental Resources or Architecture]
Student 9: [Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering] or Computer Science
Student 10: Literature, [Environmental Engineering or Computer Science]

We notice that subjects like ""Computer Science"", ""Literature"", ""Business"", ""Supplemental Resources"", and ""Global Languages"" appear more frequently and specifically ""Computer Science"", ""Literature"", ""Business"" seem to be the ones with the ""AND"" condition. So we think that including these will attract more students.

The optimal solution seems to be offering the following 5 classes:

['Computer Science', 'Literature', 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Global Languages']

Which will satisfy the following students: 

- Student 1: Will attend because Literature and Business are offered. 
- Student 2: Will attend because Supplemental Resources and Literature are offered.
- Student 4: Will attend because Computer Science and Literature are offered.
- Student 5: Will attend because Computer Science and Global Languages are offered.
- Student 6: Will attend because Global Languages is offered.
- Student 7: Will attend because Computer Science and Literature are offered.
- Student 8: Will attend because Business and Supplemental Resources are being offered.
- Student 10: Will attend because Literature and Computer Science are offered.

8 out of 10 students would attend the program that is an optimal number since many students have complementary conditions. Therefore, it's not possible to make more students attend with only 5 subjects.

","To try and make as many students as possible attend, we should aim to cover as many of the students preferences as possible. 

Starting with the students who only gave one choice (either one subject or an or-conditioned pair), we have:

1. Student 1: Business
2. Student 2: Mechanical Engineering
3. Student 3: Literature
4. Student 5: Mechanical Engineering
5. Student 6: Mechanical Engineering
6. Student 9: Planetary Sciences
7. Student 10: Business

If we count the occurrences, we get Mechanical Engineering three times, Business twice, Literature and Planetary Sciences once each. Considering we can only offer 5 subjects, we would start by choosing the most frequently mentioned ones, which gives us two subjects: Mechanical Engineering and Business.

Now, let's analyze the students who gave two conditions, framed by ""and"":

1. Student 1: Environmental Engineering and Planetary Sciences
2. Student 3: Supplemental Resources and Environmental Engineering
3. Student 4: Architecture and Literature or Computer Science
4. Student 6: Environmental Engineering and Global Languages
5. Student 7: Global Languages and Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering
6. Student 8: Mathematics and Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering
7. Student 9: Architecture and Computer Science
8. Student 10: Business and Global Languages or Supplemental Resources.

Again, if we count the occurrences, we get Environmental Engineering three times, and each of Business, Architecture, and Computer Science twice. Since we already selected Business and we can only select 3 more subjects, we would choose Environmental Engineering, Architecture, and Computer Science.

This means that the students who would attend are Student 1 (because Business is offered), Student 2 and Student 5 (because Mechanical Engineering is offered), Student 3 (because Environmental Engineering and Literature are offered), Student 4 (because Architecture and Computer Science are offered), Student 6 (because Environmental Engineering and Mechanical Engineering are included), and student 7 because we have Global Languages and Computer Science. This means, 7 out of 10 students would attend, which is optimal, as we could not get more attendance by offering other courses.

","Given the requirements listed, we need to maximize the number of students that we can accommodate with the choice of 5 subjects:
Looking at the choices, we can immediately see that 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Literature' are common among a good number of students. So that adds two subjects to our list. Next, 'Architecture' is common to three students which is higher than all the remaining subjects. For the last two subjects, 'Global Languages' and 'Environmental Engineering' appear relevant more often, so they'll be the final two subjects offered.
With these 5 subjects, the following students will attend.

1. Student 1 – We have both 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Global Languages'. Additionally, we also have 'Environmental Engineering'.
2. Student 4 – We have both 'Literature' and 'Architecture' Additionally, we also have 'Supplemental Resources'.
3. Student 7 – We have both 'Literature' and 'Supplemental Resources'.
4. Student 8 – We have both 'Literature' and 'Environmental Engineering'.
5. Student 10 – We have both 'Literature' and 'Global Languages'.

We have gotten 5 out of 10 students. Given the restrictions imposed by the input, it is not possible to satisfy more students than this, as the remaining students have requirements which are mutually exclusive with the others (i.e., selecting one of their subjects would reduce the overall number of students attending).

","Step 1: 
Let's first understand the options each student is giving.
Student 1: (Architecture, Supplemental Resources) OR Global Languages - Both must be available or the language class only.
Student 2: Literature AND (Computer Science or Global Languages) - Literature and at least one of the remaining two must be available.
Student 3: (Literature, Environmental Engineering) OR Supplemental Resources - The first two options must both be available or the resources subject.
Student 4: (Business, Architecture) OR Literature - The first two must be available or only literature.
Student 5: Planetary Sciences AND (Computer Science or Environmental Engineering) - Planetary science and one of the last two must be available.
Student 6: (Environmental Engineering, Global Languages) OR Mechanical Engineering - The first two must be available or the engineering class.
Student 7: Supplemental Resources AND (Computer Science or Business) - Resources and one of CS or Business must be available.
Student 8: (Global Languages, Mathematics) OR Business - The first two must be available or business alone.
Student 9: Business AND (Literature or Environmental Engineering) - Business and one of the last two options must be available.
Student 10: (Planetary Sciences, Business) OR Computer Science - The first two must be available or CS alone.

Step 2:
Notice that there are subjects that appear more often than others. These include Literature, Business, Supplemental Resources, Computer Science, and Environmental Engineering.

Step 3:
Aim to cover as many combinations within the above-listed subjects. The subjects that can satisfy most students are ['Literature', 'Business', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Environmental Engineering'].

Reasoning:
Student 2 will attend because Literature and Computer Science are offered.
Student 3 will attend because Literature and Environmental Engineering are offered.
Student 4 will attend because Literature is offered.
Student 7 will attend because Supplemental Resources and Computer Science are offered.
Student 9 will attend because Business and Literature are offered.
That makes 5 students attending.

It is not possible to make more students attend because each of the remaining students requires at least one subject outside of the 5 that are chosen. Even if we swap out one of our chosen subjects to satisfy one of these students, we would lose the satisfaction of at least one other student. Therefore, 5 is the maximum number of students we can satisfy.

","The first step in this problem is to count the occurrences of each course in the students' propositions and find out which courses should be more appealing. This task was done manually, just reading and counting, and resulted in the following:

- Literature: 4
- Mechanical Engineering: 5
- Architecture: 2
- Business: 3
- Supplemental Resources: 3
- Mathematics: 3
- Environmental Engineering: 3
- Planetary Sciences: 4
- Computer Science: 1
- Global Languages: 1

Looking at this breakdown we would assume that the school should offer: Literature, Planetary Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, as these are the most sought after by students. Now we have to decide between Business, Supplemental Resources, Mathematics, Environmental Engineering for the last two courses.

However, choosing the classes to offer is also about understanding the combinations of classes that will appeal to the most students which is not necessarily directly related to the frequency of each class. So, we consider the combinations each student asked for: 

Student 1 would be satisfied with (Literature and Architecture) or Mechanical Engineering.
Student 2 would be satisfied with Business and either Literature or Supplemental Resources.
And so on...

From these combinations, it's clear that the school should offer Literature and Mechanical Engineering because they are elements of the most combinations again. 

If we select Business as our third course, we cover student 2's requirement and we can select Supplemental Resources as our fourth course to confirm student 2's attendance. For our last course, we have two choices, either select Architecture to make student 1 attend or Mathematics/Environmental Engineering to make student 5 or 3 attend.

","The school needs to come up with a selection of five subjects that could satisfy the preferences of the majority of the students. To determine this, it's vital to identify the subjects that occur most frequently in the students' choices and thus are likely to attract the most students.

From the information given, the following subjects are mentioned most frequently:

  1. Mechanical Engineering (4 times)
  2. Global Languages (4 times)
  3. Computer Science (3 times)
  4. Mathematics (3 times)
  5. Planetary Sciences (3 times)

Selecting these five subjects that are most commonly mentioned, we then have to check how many students' attendance conditions are satisfied. The conditions for each student are as follows:

Student 1: Not satisfied. Only Mechanical Engineering is available.
Student 2: Not satisfied. Literature is not available.
Student 3: Satisfied. Both Global Languages and Mechanical Engineering are available.
Student 4: Satisfied. Both Planetary Sciences and either Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering are available.
Student 5: Not satisfied. Architecture is not available.
Student 6: Satisfied. Global Languages is available and either Mathematics or Planetary Sciences are available.
Student 7: Not satisfied. Architecture is not available.
Student 8: Satisfied. Mechanical Engineering is available and Mathematics is available.
Student 9: Satisfied. Mathematics is available and Planetary Sciences is available.
Student 10: Satisfied. Mathematics is available and either Planetary Sciences or Global Languages are available.

Therefore, the combination of 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Global Languages', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics', and 'Planetary Sciences' gives the maximum possible attendance of 6 out of 10 students (Students 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 will attend) which is more than half and therefore the most we could hope for given the constraints.

Please explain your answer step by step and break it down into smaller steps. Explain which students will attend based on your choice, and why it is not possible to make more students attend.
Do not write code that implements an algorithm — you're instructed to provide an answer.
The last line of your answer must begin with ""OFFERED COURSES:"" and then contain a Python list with 5 distinct elements of ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Literature', 'Architecture', 'Global Languages', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Engineering']. For example, the last line might look like this:

","To solve this problem, first, realize that each student requires two subjects to attend the course, except Student 2, who might attend with only one course: ""Supplemental Resources"". Therefore, it would be impossible to satisfy all students, as that would require more than 5 subjects. Our goal is then to satisfy as many students as possible. 

First Step: Analyze Student 2's statement, they might attend with ""Supplemental Resources"" alone. If ""Supplemental Resources"" is offered, this student will attend, this subject will also satisfy part of Student 1, 4, 6, and 7's preferences. Therefore, This should definitely be one of the 5 courses.

Second Step: Analyze the lists starting by the ones that reuse the ""Supplemental Resources"" selected. 
Student 1: reuses ""Supplemental Resources"", completing this student preference involves ""Mathematics"", ""Architecture"", at least one should be offered to get this student attending. Both ""Mathematics"", ""Architecture"" seems to have a high frequency in other student preferences. ""Mathematics"" appears 3 times while ""Architecture"" appears 4 times.

Third Step: Analyze the remaining lists using frequency to make a decision. Adding ""Mathematics"" would satisfy Student 10 and partially satisfies Student 8. Adding ""Architecture"" would partially satisfy student 5 and 9.

Offering ""Architecture"" together with ""Supplemental Resources"" have the potential to attract 5 students, although none will be fully satisfied except Student 2. Offering ""Mathematics"" together with ""Supplemental Resources"" have the potential to attract four students, only 1 (Student 2) fully satisfied.

Maximizing satisfaction, then, involves choosing ""Architecture"". 

Fourth Step: From the remaining students (3,5,6,9)

Student 3's preference might be completed by offering ""Computer Science"". This does not have any reutilization potential and could potentially bring one additional student to the class, making at most 6.

Student 5's preference might be completed by offering ""Business"". This has the potential of reutilization as it appears in the list of Student 7, 8, and 10. This could potentially bring more 3 students, making at most 8.

Student 6's preference might be completed by offering ""Computer Science"", as in student 3's case, this has no reutilization potential. This could potentially bring one additional student, making at most 6.

Student 9's preference might be completed by offering ""Mechanical Engineering"". This does not have any reutilization potential either and could potentially bring one additional student. This could potentially bring one additional student, making at most 6.

The best option is to offer ""Business"", attempting to maximize the number of students.

Fifth Step: After choosing ""Business"", a common subject in Student 1, 5 7, and 8's preferences, from these, 
- Offering Math will complete the preferences of Students 1 and 8. Potentially attracting at most 10 students. 
- Offering Computer science will complete the preferences of Student 7. Potentially attracting at most 9 students.

The best option is then, to offer ""Math"".

Sixth Step: With Four subjects selected [""Supplemental Resources"",""Architecture"",""Business"",""Math""], the resulting students preferences are:

- Student 1: completely satisfied;
- Student 2: completely satisfied;
- Student 3: partially satisfied;
- Student 4: partially satisfied;
- Student 5: completely satisfied;
- Student 6: completely satisfied;
- Student 7: partially satisfied;
- Student 8: completely satisfied;
- Student 9: partially satisfied;
- Student 10: completely satisfied;

""Computer Science"" might complete the preferences of Students 3, 6, and 7. ""Literature"" might complete Student 4's preferences. ""Mechanical Engineering"" might complete the preferences of Students 3 and 9. ""Global Languages"" might complete Student 5's list. On frequency, ""Computer Science"" is the best option, potentially attracting 3 additional students. 

The best overall selection given all the constraints would be to offer ""Supplemental Resources"", ""Architecture"", ""Business"", ""Math"", ""Computer Science"" potentially attracting all students apart from Students 4 and 9.

","To find the optimal number of students who can attend, we need to identify classes that are most common across the students' choices. 

On a first reading, we find that ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Global Languages"", ""Computer Science"", ""Mathematics"" and ""Architecture"" appear quite commonly. So, let's verify how many students can attend if these subjects were to be offered.

1. ""Planetary Sciences"" - This subject is listed by Student 1, Student 2, Student 4, and Student 5. So, these 4 students will attend.
2. ""Global Languages"" - This subject is listed by Student 1, Student 2, and Student 3, of which Students 1 and 2 will already attend due to ""Planetary Sciences"". Therefore, it specifically makes Student 3 to attend.
3. ""Computer Science"" - This is listed by Student 3, Student 4, Student 8, and Student 9. Here, Student 3 is already attending due to ""Global Languages"". Therefore, it specifically makes Students 4, 8 and 9 to attend.
4. ""Mathematics"" - This subject is listed by Student 4, Student 5, Student 6, and student 8. Here, Students 4 and 8 are already attending so it specifically makes Student 5 and 6 to attend.
5. ""Architecture"" - This is listed by Student 2, Student 6, Student 7, and Student 9. Here, Students 2, 6 and 9 are already attending so it specifically makes Student 7 to attend.

From the list, we see that by offering ""Planetary Sciences"", ""Global Languages"", ""Computer Science"", ""Mathematics"", and ""Architecture"", a total of 8 students (Students 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) will attend. We know this is the maximum because there are only 10 students and each student requires at least two classes, so at most we could satisfy 5 students' exact requirements. Since we satisfy more than this, we have found the optimal solution.

","To find the correct courses is a complex problem, but after comparing and evaluating the prerequisites from all students, it seems there are common courses that can get the most students to attend. 

Firstly, there are two subjects that appear more frequently in the students' choices: Architecture and Supplemental Resources. These are each required by 4 students. Other than these two, Planetary Sciences and Computer Science are chosen by 3 students. Therefore, we should consider these four subjects as the first 4 on our list.

However, for the fifth course, it's a tough decision because we have multiple choices. We can't make all remaining students attend because they have different preferences.

If we choose Mechanical Engineering, students 4 and 8 will attend which gives us 7 students total. But if we choose Literature instead, students 4 and 6 will attend, also resulting in 7 students. No other subject on this last position could result in more than 6 students attending.

Next, lets see if we can get more than 7 students to attend by changing the first four courses. It's clear that no matter which courses are offered, students 5, 7, and 10 will not attend since their preferences don't fall in line with the majority.

After comparing these possible combinations, it becomes clear that the 7 students' attendance is the maximum we can reach. 

- If we choose Mechanical Engineering, Student 1,2,3,4,8 and 9 will attend the Summer program but this combination leaves out Student 6.
- If we choose Literature,  Student 1,2,3,4,6 and 9 will attend but leaves out Student 8. 

The above analysis shows that we could not please every student based on their individual conditional statements. It's important to aim for pleasing as many students as possible within the constraints. 

Therefore, both of the following set of courses will result in the highest amount of students attending:

OFFERED COURSES: ['Architecture', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering']

","After breaking down each student's preference, this is a difficult problem to solve. This is because no subject will satisfy all students and the school needs to decide based on prioritizing maximum student satisfaction.

We notice that 'Mathematics' and 'Supplemental Resources' play a crucial role in many students' criteria. But at the same time 'Computer Science' seems equally important too.

Step 1: Assuming we decide to go with 'Mathematics' and 'Supplemental Resources', which are the first subject from student 1's statement and the alternative subject from the student's 1 statement. Student 1 will attend if we offer 'Mathematics' and 'Supplemental Resources'. Similarly, student 5 and student 6 will also attend if we offer 'Mathematics' and 'Supplemental Resources'.

Step 2: Next, if we pick 'Computer Science', which is there in other students' preferences too, we could then satisfy student 3 and student 7 requirements.

Step 3: The major dilemma arises when we got one extra spot to choose and we have to choose between 'Global Languages' and 'Business'. Choosing 'Global Languages' would mean getting student 10's preference met (because we've already included 'Supplemental Resources' which was needed by him), but will fail to meet student 4 and student 5's preference because 'Business' hasn't been offered and we've exhausted our limit of 5 subjects. 

Step 4: Conversely, if we choose 'Business', this would satisfy the student 4 and student 5 because we've already included 'Supplemental Resources', but will fail to satisfy student 10's preference as 'Global Languages' is not offered. 

Given the situation, it would be logical to choose 'Business' as this will satisfy two students as compared to the one if we choose 'Global Languages' in the 5th spot.

The final list which satisfies maximum students according to their preference becomes:

With the current selection of 5 courses, we already have 5 students able to attend. There's no way to increase the attendance without exceeding the course limits. If you look at the remaining students conditions, none of them can be satisfied without removing a course that would prevent one of the current 5 students from attending.

","First, we need to analyze the constraints by putting together the demands of all students and picking the most common course preferences. It’s noticeable that the subject ""Supplemental Resources"" appears most often, and is the only subject benefiting 4 students (Student 1, Student 2, Student 4 and Student 7). Taking this into consideration, we can include it in our course offering.

Secondly, it's apparent that two more courses stand out by looking at the options: ""Literature"" and ""Computer Science"" appear together in Student 1 and Student 4. Also, there are courses such as ""Planetary Sciences"" and ""Architecture"", that whilst similarly are commonly in several statements, they each need to be with a third course to satisfy the student demands. There are only 5 spots for courses and we can't afford to spend 3 spots to satisfy just two students.

Therefore, choosing ""Computer Science"" and ""Literature"" is logically more efficient as it adds three students (Student 1, Student 4, and indirectly Student 7, who wants either Supplemental Resources plus Planetary Sciences or Literature). Now, we are at a point where we have to pick one more course from [""Planetary Sciences"", ""Architecture"", ""Mechanical Engineering"", ""Mathematics""] to satisfy as many students as possible.

Adding ""Mechanical Engineering"" will attract Student 2, ""Planetary Sciences"" will bring in Student 3, ""Architecture"" can attract Student 5 and ""Mathematics"" won't attract any additional student because the remaining students whose choices contain Mathematics also require Architecture but Student 5 only needs one of two: Mechanical Engineering or Mathematics. Hence, it is better to select ""Mechanical Engineering"" so Student 2 and Student 5 will attend the classes too.

Counting the students who will attend, we see that we will get 5 students so far (Student 1, Student 2, Student 4, Student 5, and Student 7). Now, we are left with two available spots. 

Looking at the remaining students, Student 3, Student 6, Student 8, Student 9, and Student 10, they all tend to have requirements containing subjects we've already covered and an extra subject. Given that we have 2 empty spots, we should look for 2 subjects that appear most frequently among these students. We can see that ""Business"" will attract Student 9 and ""Planetary Sciences"" will attract Student 10, resulting in 2 additional students to make a total of 7 students.

Now, if we were to add any other class, none of the remaining 3 students will attend the program because they still lack a class in their choice. 

In conclusion, the 5 classes that would allow for the most students to attend are ['Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Planetary Sciences'] or ['Supplemental Resources', 'Literature', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Business']. The two options will attract 7 out of 10 students.

In this case, the first option appears to be the ideal choice because the subject ""Business"" compared to ""Planetary Sciences"" is mentioned less frequently throughout the students' preferences and thus we can assume it might be less likely to attract additional students in the future.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","First, we need to analyze the conditions given by each student and find the most common subjects. 

Looking closely we can see that:
- Mechanical Engineering is requested by 5 students.
- Environmental Engineering is requested by 4 students.
- Business and Supplemental Resources are requested by 3 students each.
- Architecture and Mathematics are requested by 4 students each.

Using this data, we can try to generate the largest consensus among students by choosing the most requested subjects. This does not guarantee that all students will attend, but it is a systematic approach to include as many students as possible.

Now, the next step is to see how many students can be satisfied by each subject. 

We can start by definitely including 'Mechanical Engineering' since it's the highest requested subject.

Next, we see that 'Environmental Engineering' has the second-highest requests and also satisfies the conditions set by Student 2 and Student 6 who also chose 'Mechanical Engineering' in their preferences. This guarantees the attendance of at least 2 students.

Now, let's consider including 'Business' because it satisfies Student 1 who also picked 'Mechanical Engineering'.

The fourth subject we can include should be 'Architecture', as this will satisfy Student 3.

Finally, we include the subject 'Mathematics' which is frequently requested and also satisfies Student 7 who also chose 'Mechanical Engineering'.

By following the decision above, we can satisfy the conditions of Student 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7. 
All these students requested 'Mechanical Engineering' and at least one more subject from our final list. None of the other possible selections of 5 subjects can guarantee the attendance of more students.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","The goal here is to choose 5 subjects that will result in the maximum number of students attending the summer program. Looking at the subjects that the students chose, best way is to look for common subjects across students:

- 'Computer Science' appears in the preferences of 3 students.
- 'Business' appears in the preferences of 3 students.
- 'Mathematics' appears in the preferences of 2 students.
- 'Mechanical Engineering' appears in the preferences of 2 students.
- 'Literature' appears in the preferences of 3 students.
- 'Architecture' appears in the preferences of 2 students.
- 'Global Languages' appears in the preferences of 5 students.
- 'Supplemental Resources' appears in the preferences of 3 students.
- 'Planetary Sciences' appears in the preferences of 3 students.
- 'Environmental Engineering' appears in the preferences of 3 students.

Based on this, 'Global Languages' is a subject which appears most frequently in the students’ preferences; 5 times. We need to make it one of the offered subjects.

Next, subjects 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Literature', 'Supplemental Resources', 'Planetary Sciences', and 'Environmental Engineering' are tied for next most popular, each appearing thrice. We can't offer all, since we have to offer exactly 5 subjects and we have already selected 'Global Languages'. 

To make a decision based on these tied subjects, we also need to consider combinations that students stated. For example, offering both 'Computer Science' and 'Global Languages' will make Students 4, 10 attend the program.

Similarly, offering 'Business', 'Global Languages' and 'Planetary Sciences' will make Students 2, 3 and 10 attend the program. Offering 'Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Supplemental Resources' will make Students 3, 4, and 7 attend the program. These combinations result in more students.

From these comparisons, the subjects: 'Business', 'Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', and either 'Computer Science' or 'Environmental Engineering' satisfy the most students, so the school should offer these.

However, choosing between 'Computer Science' and 'Environmental Engineering' is tricky. If we check the choices, 'Computer Science' allows Students 1, 4, 10 to attend if chosen because it fulfills their conditions. On the other hand, 'Environmental Engineering' allows Students 5, 9 to attend if chosen because it fulfills their conditions.

Therefore, it's clear that we should choose 'Computer Science' over 'Environmental Engineering'. In summary, if we offer 'Business', 'Global Languages', 'Planetary Sciences', 'Supplemental Resources', and 'Computer Science', Students 1,2,3,4,7,10 will attend the summer program.

","In order to satisfy as many students as possible, we would have to look at the classes that appear most frequently across all the students' preferences and look for combinations that can satisfy more than one student. 

1. 'Business' is frequently mentioned. 
2. 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Mathematics' both could satisfy Student 1 and Student 5 if coupled with 'Literature'.
3. 'Architecture' appears multiple times, but choosing it would only satisfy Student 2 if coupled with 'Planetary Sciences' or 'Environmental Engineering', or Student 3 if 'Business' is also chosen, or Student 7 if 'Global Languages' is also chosen.
4. 'Computer Science' appears a couple of times, but we cannot consider it because choosing it would use our fifth spot without satisfying another student (we can only choose 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mathematics', and 'Literature').

Taking into account that we can only offer 5 courses, it would seem the best combination to get the most students to attend is by offering 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', and a fifth course either 'Computer Science' or 'Architecture'.
Let's evaluate:

- With 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', and 'Computer Science', Students 1, 3, 5 and 6 will attend.
- With 'Business', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', and 'Architecture', Students 1, 3, and 5 will attend.

Therefore, in order to maximise the number of student we'd need to choose 'Computer Science' as our fifth subject.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","The process to select the courses could be:

1. First, notice that the courses required by each student are joined by ""and"" and ""or"". The ""and"" means that both courses are required by that student, but the ""or"" means that only one of them is needed, not necessarily both. For example, student 1 needs ""Global Languages"" and either ""Mechanical Engineering"" or ""Architecture"".
2. Identify the most popular courses, i.e., the ones that appear most likely to allow the majority of students to attend. Here we see that 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', and 'Mechanical Engineering' are most popular and are mentioned by 5, 4 and 4 students respectively.

Based on the above observation, we can start with these three courses: 'Supplemental Resources', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering'.

3. Now we need to choose 2 more courses from the remaining options. Since we’ve already selected 'Supplemental Resources' and 'Mechanical Engineering', Student 3's requirements are already fulfilled. But to include other students we need to select our remaining two courses carefully. Courses that can attract more students are 'Planetary Sciences' and 'Business'.

Having selected those, on counting we see that this combination allows six students to attend: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10.

   - Student 2: ""Computer Science and (Planetary Sciences or Environmental Engineering)""
   - Student 3: ""Supplemental Resources and (Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering)""
   - Student 4: ""(Business and Mathematics) or Planetary Sciences""
   - Student 7: ""(Mechanical Engineering and Supplemental Resources) or Environmental Engineering""
   - Student 8: ""Computer Science and (Mechanical Engineering or Supplemental Resources)""
   - Student 10: ""(Supplemental Resources and Planetary Sciences) or Business""

Please note that each ""and"" condition would require us to select two courses and likewise, each ""or"" condition would allow us to choose any one course but still fulfill the student's condition. So, 'Planetary Sciences' by itself fulfilled student 4 and 10's conditions while 'Business' allowed another condition of student 4 and 10 to be fulfilled, thus allowing us to maximize the no. of students attending.

4. This means we cannot include more students since it requires adding more than 2 additional subjects, exceeding the limit of 5 courses.

- Student 9: (Business + Mathematics) OR Architecture
- Student 10: Architecture + (Planetary Sciences OR Mathematics)

In order to decide which 5 subjects the school should offer, we need to take into account the common preferences of the highest possible number of students. Observing the students' preferences, we can notice some subjects that appear more frequently:

- Mathematics: appears in 5 students' choices
- Business: appears in 3 students' choices
- Computer Science: appears in 3 students' choices
- Architecture: appears in 3 students' choices
- Global Languages: appears in 3 students' choices
- Literature: appears in 2 students' choices
- Environmental Engineering: appears in 2 students' choices

Where the subjects which appear the most are Mathematics, Business, Computer Science, Architecture, and Global Languages.

However, just picking those won't satisfy the maximal number of students. So let's check the frequency of pairings:

- (Business, Mathematics): It will satisfy 2 students (2, 9)
- (Architecture, Mathematics): It will satisfy 1 student (10)
- (Computer Science, Mathematics): It will satisfy 1 student (8)

At this point, it's clear that offering Mathematics as a subject is very critical and offering any two other subjects from Business, Architecture, or Computer Science along with it involves a set of 3 students.

If we add Business and Computer Science along with Mathematics, this will attract 3 students. 

There are 2 slots remaining; we can't include 'Global Languages' because no student will come based purely on this subject.

Including 'Architecture', we can coax student 10 if we can accommodate Planetary Sciences. No other pair matches, so it's better to attract at least one more student. 

As for the last slot, 'Environmental Engineering' would bring in student 5 since Computer Science is also being offered. That means with these 5 subjects, we can have five students (2, 8, 9, 10, 5) coming in.

","This problem can be solved through exhaustive selection. We need to concern ourselves with combinations that appeal to more than one student, while at the same time maximizing the number of students.

Let's break down each student's preferences:

1. Mechanical Engineering and (Business or Supplemental Resources)
2. Environmental Engineering and (Literature or Architecture)
3. (Environmental Engineering and Literature) or Planetary Sciences
4. (Architecture and Business) or Mathematics
5. Global Languages and (Architecture or Supplemental Resources)
6. (Mathematics and Planetary Sciences) or Environmental Engineering
7. Business and (Computer Science or Environmental Engineering)
8. Mechanical Engineering and (Business or Planetary Sciences)
9. (Business and Computer Science) or Planetary Sciences
10. Mathematics and (Computer Science or Global Languages)

We note that Environmental Engineering is a popular course, making 3 students (2, 3 and 6) possibly attend. 
In the case of student 2, we only need one more course, either Literature or Architecture to ensure their attendance.

Literature, however, only appears in student 2's preference and nowhere else. Architecture on the other hand appears in 2 other students' preferences (4 and 5). This makes Architecture a better choice.

For Student 3, if (Environmental Engineering and Literature) or Planetary Sciences is offered, they would attend. As we already included Environmental Engineering but not Literature, having Planetary Sciences would ensure this student attends as well.

So far, for the first 3 students, we have only had to offer: Environmental Engineering, Architecture, and Planetary Sciences.

Looking at Student 5, ""I would attend the program if and only if Global Languages and (Architecture or Supplemental Resources) is offered"". Adding Global Languages also gets Student 5 to attend.

Business appeals to 4 students (1,4,7,8). Adding this to our course list will mean that student 8 will also attend because they need Mechanical Engineering and (Business or Planetary Sciences). As we are already offering Business and Planetary Sciences, they will attend.

To revise, the following students will now attend: 2,3,5,8.

Unfortunately, due to this choice of 5 classes, we cannot get any more students to attend. The required classes for other students require offering more than one additional class, or replacing a class that would result in less students attending overall. 

The 5 courses that should be offered are:

","While going through the series of statements trying to optimize the maximum number of students, it can be observed that the 'Planetary Sciences' subject appears in several statements indicating it could be a common contributing factor which can lead to the attendance of multiple students, i.e., 1, 2, 7, 9, and 10. 

Let's take 'Planetary Sciences' as the first subject.

Student 10 also needs 'Computer Science' to attend, but this subject is not mentioned in any other student's conditions. Meanwhile, Student 9 needs 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Literature' to attend with 'Planetary Sciences'. As Student 3 and 5 also mention either 'Mechanical Engineering' or 'Literature' in their condition, 'Mechanical Engineering' and 'Literature' could be our next choices for the offered courses as it will cause students 3, 5, 9 to attend.

Next, the school needs to offer 2 more different subjects to maximize students' attendance. Because Student 5 only needs 'Global Languages' or 'Business' to attend with 'Mechanical Engineering', and student 8 will attend if 'Mathematics' and ('Global Languages' or 'Architecture') is selected. We can then take 'Business' and 'Global Languages' as our final subjects to offer. 

This will result in attendance from students 1, 3, 5, 9, and 10 - a total of 5 students. It is not possible to get more students to attend even if we try to adjust the subjects as it will always result in lower attendance due to the restrictive conditions of the students.

","The task at hand requires careful planning and a lot of observation. The school's decision is based on the condition that exactly 5 subjects will be offered. So, let's take the task step by step:

Our goal is to maximize student attendance by picking the most popular subjects mentioned by the students. 

Let's start by looking at the subjects that are mentioned most often:

1. Business is mentioned by 4 students (Students 2, 3, 6, and 7).
2. Mathematics is mentioned by 4 students (Students 4, 5, 6, and 8).
3. Computer Science is mentioned by 3 students (Students 3, 4, and 10).
4. Global Languages is mentioned by 3 students (Students 1, 5, and 10).
5. Planetary Sciences is mentioned by 3 students (Students 1, 2, and 8).

It seems like the key to maximizing attendance lies in the selection of the first three courses. By selecting 'Business', 'Mathematics', and 'Computer Science', we include the preferences of 6 unique students (Students 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10).

Students 5 and 1 share an interest in 'Global Languages', but this would not bring in any new students, as Student 10 is also interested in 'Global Languages' but has already been accounted for through 'Computer Science' already. 

Therefore, the remaining 2 subjects must be chosen in such a way that they cater to the remaining four students without disrupting the course choices validated by the first six students. The subject 'Global Languages' allows us to add Student 1 to the roster, bringing the current count to 7 students. 

Finally, the addition of 'Mechanical Engineering' allows us to add Student 9, bolstering our count to 8 total students served.

Therefore, we maximize the number of students attending by offering the courses that are popular among the majority of them.

This leaves us with 2 students (Students 7 and 8) who will not attend the program no matter the final course choice, as their preferences simply cannot be accommodated using the subjects remaining. However, this strategy allows us to cater to the needs of 8 out of the 10 students, thus fulfilling the maximum possible attendance scenario.

Hence, the school should offer the following subjects:

","Based on the students' statements, I go through the process below to find a set of 5 courses that will attract the most students:

Consider student 1: ""I would attend the program if and only if (Supplemental Resources and Architecture) or Business is offered.""
If Business is offered, we don't need to add Supplemental Resources and Architecture to our list, and thus, we have more room for other courses.

Now, to capture student 2, add Mathematics, Environmental Engineering and Global Languages to our list.

Until now, we have selected the following courses: ['Business', 'Mathematics', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Global Languages'].

Next, if we add Architecture to our list, we can capture student 1, 4 and 6, making the highest number of students that the school can attract.

If Computer Science, or Mechanical Engineering were selected instead, only one more student could have been potentially included compared to three by choosing Architecture.

Therefore, selecting ['Business', 'Mathematics', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Global Languages', 'Architecture'] attracts 4 students (1, 2, 4, 6) which is the highest number possible with each student requiring at least two classes in most cases.

","Before we make the class selection, it is important to note that we need to simultaneously make as many students attend. In order to accomplish this, it's smart to maximize the number of common classes in the students' statements. 

Having said that, our primary goal should be serving the largest possible number of students, even if some of them might be happier with a different option.

Step 1: Going through Student 1 to Student 10's preferences once again, an interesting pattern is evident. ""Literature"" is mentioned more frequently than any other subject (5 times). Therefore, this subject must be included in our course offerings.

Step 2: Similarly, ""Global Languages"" and ""Computer Science"" are both popular choices among the students' statements (3 times each). These two subjects should be offered.

Step 3: ""Architecture"" and ""Planetary Sciences"" are both shared by two students. They are our fourth and fifth course offerings.

With our five course choices being Literature, Global Languages, Computer Science, Architecture, and Planetary Sciences, let's see which students will be able to attend based on their stated preferences.

- Student 1 will attend since Planetary Sciences is offered.
- Student 2 will attend since Literature and Computer Science are offered.
- Student 3 will attend since Architecture and Literature are offered.
- Student 4 will attend since Literature and Planetary Sciences are offered.
- Student 5 will attend since Global Languages and Architecture are offered.
- Student 6 will not attend since the combo of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science is not offered.
- Student 7 will not attend since the combo of Mathematics and Literature is not offered.
- Student 8 will not attend since the combo of Literature and Supplemental Resources is not offered.
- Student 9 will attend since Architecture and Global Languages are offered.
- Student 10 will attend since the combo of Computer Science and Literature is offered.

By selecting these five courses, we have managed to attract 7 out of 10 students, which is the maximum we can achieve. To include more students, we would have to exclude others due to our limit of 5 course offerings.

Final step: The chosen class offerings are Literature, Global Languages, Computer Science, Architecture, and Planetary Sciences.

","The goal is to create a combination of subjects so that the most students will attend the summer program. Each student has two groups of subjects they're interested in (with a possibility of overlap), and they will attend if at least one group is fully represented among the offered courses. 

Because the program can only offer 5 subjects and some students have preferences that overlap less than others, we need to prioritize the combinations that can satisfy the largest groups of students.

If we breakdown each student's requirements:

1. Planetary Sciences, Mathematics or Environmental Engineering
2. Computer Science, Mathematics or Environmental Engineering
3. Literature, Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science
4. Planetary Sciences, Mechanical Engineering or Business
5. Global Languages, Architecture or Mathematics
6. Global Languages, Architecture or Mathematics
7. Environmental Engineering, Literature or Mathematics
8. Business, Architecture or Supplemental Resources
9. Computer Science, Architecture or Planetary Sciences
10. Architecture, Mechanical Engineering or Global Languages

We have to pick the 5 subjects where there are the most overlaps in students' preferences.

After analysing these requirements, we should offer the courses: 'Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Architecture' and 'Mathematics'. 

This is because:

- Student 1 will attend because we are offering Planetary Sciences and Mathematics.
- Student 2 will attend because we are offering Computer Science and Mathematics.
- Student 3 will attend because we are offering Literature and Computer Science.
- Student 4 will attend because we are offering Planetary Sciences and Mechanical Engineering.
- Student 5 will attend because we are offering Global Languages and Mathematics.
- Student 10 will attend because we are offering Architecture and Mechanical Engineering.

Hence, by offering these subjects, we can get 6 out of 10 students to attend the program, which is the maximum achievable considering the given constraints.

","Looking at the student's preferences, one will notice a couple of classes that keep appearing: 'Computer Science', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Mathematics', and 'Environmental Engineering'. These specifically pop up several times in student's preference.

For Student 1 to attend, we need 'Architecture' and either 'Environmental Engineering' or 'Global Languages'. Let's pick 'Architecture' and 'Environmental Engineering' because 'Environmental Engineering' also shows up again in Student 10's preference. This would mean we would cover the preferences of Student 1 and potentially Student 10 if we also ensure we have 'Business'.

For Student 2 to attend, they need 'Business' and either 'Architecture' or 'Computer Science'. If we picked 'Business', 'Computer Science', and 'Architecture', students 1, 2, 8, and 9 would be able to attend because their preferences would be covered.

'Computer Science' also shows up in the preferences of Student 3 and Student 5 and picking it alongside 'Mathematics' covers these students as well.

From these insights, the best combination of subjects would be ['Computer Science', 'Business', 'Architecture', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Mathematics'].

The attending students would be 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10. It will not be possible to add more students without removing some of these students because each of the remaining Student's preferences (4, 6, 7) contains a subject not in the five selected.

","From the students’ statements we can deduce the following:

Certain subjects like Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics are mentioned more than others, so considering the popularity these subjects have a higher chance of attracting more students.

Also, students are more likely to participate if the subjects are either paired with another popular subject or compared to a less popular subject. For instance, in student 1’s requirement, he/she will attend if Mechanical Engineering is offered with either of Global Languages or Architecture. Thus, offering Mechanical Engineering can potentially make this student attend the program. However, the conditions set by students must also be met for them to attend the program.

We should also examine if some class preferences can cover more students. In this case, Computer Science in student 2's and 3’s options cover two students. So, we should consider making that one of the subjects.

By analyzing these preferences, we can choose subjects that will attract most students. A possible solution might be:

Mechanical Engineering: Students 1, 5, 7, 10 prefer this subject, so offering it will potentially make these 4 attend.

Computer Science: Students 2, 3, 10 will likely attend if it’s offered. We already count student 10 in Mechanical Engineering, so offering this subject will make 2 more students for a total of 6.

Mathematics: Students 5, 7, 8, 10 indicate they will attend if Mathematics is offered. We already count students 5, 7, 10 in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, so adding Mathematics will make 1 more student for a total of 7.

Literature: Only students 3 and 5 will attend if it’s offered. We have already counted these students so it will not bring new students.

Business: Only students 4, 7, 9 will attend if it’s offered. We have already counted students 7 in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics, so adding Business will make 2 new students for a total of 9.

Finally, we should choose a subject that is paired with the remaining one, while not being in students’ list who were already covered.

Supplemental Resources: Only student 4 will attend if it’s offered. We have already counted student 4 in Business, so adding Supplemental Resources will make no new students.

We can see here that no matter which subject we offer in the 5th position it won’t attract a new student.

So, with this logic, we can cater to a maximum of 9 students.

For example, the last line might look like this:

","To determine which courses the school should offer, we can start by mapping out the conditions that each student has stated, and finding overlap in these conditions. 

Student 1: Two distinct options: Computer Science and Architecture OR Environmental Engineering.
Student 2: Three distinct options: Supplemental Resources and either Literature or Business.
Student 3: Three distinct options: Mechanical Engineering and either Global languages or Computer Science.
Student 4: Three distinct options: Architecture and either Computer Science or Planetary Sciences.
Student 5: Three distinct options: Literature and either Architecture or Computer Science.
Student 6: Three distinct options: Supplemental Resources and Mechanical Engineering OR Mathematics.
Student 7: Three distinct options: Environmental Engineering and Planetary Sciences OR Mechanical Engineering.
Student 8: Three distinct options: Planetary Sciences and either Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering.
Student 9: Three distinct options: Global Languages and either Planetary Sciences or Business.
Student 10: Three distinct options: Planetary Sciences and Mathematics OR Global Languages.

From these requirements, we can see that the subjects Computer Science, Architecture and Mechanical Engineering appear most frequently, each appearing 4 times. Supplemental Resources, Planetary Sciences and Global languages appears 3 times. Literature, Business, Mathematics and Environmental Engineering are mentioned 2 times. 

From the above conditions, we also see that some courses such as Mechanical Engineering, Planetary Sciences and Mathematics are sometimes the only requirement for some students. 

Therefore, to cover as many students as possible, the courses should include: Computer Science, Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Planetary Sciences, Mathematics.

With this selection:

- Student 1: Will attend, as Architecture and Computer Science are offered.
- Student 3: Will attend, as Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science are offered.
- Student 4: Will attend, as Architecture and Computer Science are offered.
- Student 6: Will attend, as Mathematics is offered.
- Student 7: Will attend, as Mechanical Engineering is offered.
- Student 8: Will attend, as Planetary Sciences and either Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering are offered.
- Student 10: Will attend, as Planetary Sciences and Mathematics are offered.

That means 7 out of 10 students will attend, which is a good outcome. We cannot increase this number without offering more than 5 subjects.

","Since the school can only offer 5 subjects, students will have to make their choice based on whether their preferred subject combination includes at least one picked subject.

To ensure that the maximum number of students can attend, we must find a subject combination that accommodates most preferences.

Step 1: Analyze student preferences.
If we look at the conditions given by students, 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Business' are in high demand. Most students have chosen one or both of these in their preferences.

Step 2: Choosing Subjects.
So let's start by definitely offering these three subjects: 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', and 'Business'. 

This satisfies at least part of the conditions for Students 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
Student 8 will also attend if we offer 'Business'.

Now we have two subjects left to offer.

Step 3: Maximize Student Attendance.
By offering 'Global Languages', we fully satisfy the conditions of Student 1 and partially satisfy the conditions of Student 3 and Student 4.

We have one subject to offer.
By offering 'Supplemental Resources', we fully satisfy the conditions of Student 4 and partially satisfy the condition of Student 6.

So, with 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Business', 'Global Languages' and 'Supplemental Resources', we can get maximum of 7 students: Student 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10.

We can't make any other combination of 5 subjects that will attract more than 7 students. For example, if we replace 'Supplemental Resources' with 'Mathematics', only Student 2 and 6 will be added but we would lose Students 4 and 8.

Therefore, the school should offer 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Business', 'Global Languages', and 'Supplemental Resources' to get maximum student attendance.
