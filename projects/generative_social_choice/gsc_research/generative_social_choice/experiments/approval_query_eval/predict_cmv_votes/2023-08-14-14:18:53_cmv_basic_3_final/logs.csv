""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units.

""This view sets up a false dichotomy.

""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units.

Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being.

""This view sets up a false dichotomy.

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else.

Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units.

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units.

Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being.

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy.

""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century.

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units.

Opinion (what person believes):

""This view sets up a false dichotomy.

","I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement).

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.""

Statement:  
""We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


Opinion (what person believes):
""It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.""

Statement:  
""This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.""

Statement:  
""There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


Opinion (what person believes):
""Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?""

Statement:  
""Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No


This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else. 



Opinion (what person believes):
""While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.""

Statement:  
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""
