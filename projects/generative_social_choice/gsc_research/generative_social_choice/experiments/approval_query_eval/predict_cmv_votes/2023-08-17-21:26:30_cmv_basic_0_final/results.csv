Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.",37286383,"While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps.
