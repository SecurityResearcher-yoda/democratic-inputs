As a UX designer, I believe that each user has distinctive interests and desires with what they are searching/asking for, therefore chatbots should cater to their specific needs when prompted. This in turn, will provide each user with valuable information that will efficiently meet the goals and needs of the user in a timely manner. However, like the prompt above, I do believe that there should be a balance between personalization and privacy. The chatbot should respect the user by giving a general answer to any prompted questions IN ADDITION to the somewhat personalized answers. To emphasize the prompt above, it must be apparent to uphold...\"clear ethical boundaries,\" which are \"essential to maintain user trust and ensure data security,\" which I firmly agree with. I know that if I were to utilize chatbots for any reason, I would not want to feel that the chatbot is overstepping the boundaries and getting too much of my information!)\n",
