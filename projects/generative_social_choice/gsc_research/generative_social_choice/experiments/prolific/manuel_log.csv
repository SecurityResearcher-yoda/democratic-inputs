We asked a group of {n} people the following question: 
""{question}""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


{answers}


As a summary, I will now extract the 3 points raised most frequently by this group of people. I will try to be as precise as possible precise and I will include also the reasoning made by the participants. I will use no more than 3 sentences per point, and each point will be coherent, self-contained, and well-written. Here are these 3 main points, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

","{'n': 21, 'question': 'To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?', 'answers': ['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect.

We asked a group of 21 people the following question: 
""To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect.

As a summary, I will now extract the 3 points raised most frequently by this group of people. I will try to be as precise as possible precise and I will include also the reasoning made by the participants. I will use no more than 3 sentences per point, and each point will be coherent, self-contained, and well-written. Here are these 3 main points, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

We asked a group of {n} people the following question: 
""{question}""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


{answers}


As a summary, I will now extract the 3 points raised most frequently by this group of people. I will try to be as precise as possible precise and I will include also the reasoning made by the participants. I will use no more than 3 sentences per point, and each point will be coherent, self-contained, and well-written. Here are these 3 main points, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

","{'n': 21, 'question': 'To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?', 'answers': ['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this.

We asked a group of 21 people the following question: 
""To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this.

As a summary, I will now extract the 3 points raised most frequently by this group of people. I will try to be as precise as possible precise and I will include also the reasoning made by the participants. I will use no more than 3 sentences per point, and each point will be coherent, self-contained, and well-written. Here are these 3 main points, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

We asked a group of {n} people the following question: 
""{question}""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


{answers}


As a summary, I will now extract the 3 points raised most frequently by this group of people. I will be as precise as possible precise and I will include also the reasoning made by the participants. I will use no more than 3 sentences per point, and each point will be coherent, self-contained, and well-written. Here are these 3 main points, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

","{'n': 21, 'question': 'To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?', 'answers': ['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this. In a way, this is already happening in examples when you shop on websites and they tailor/suggest other items for you based on what you searched for. I don\'t see smaller/less evasive intrusions like this a problem. Now, if the personalization gets too ""personal"" such as giving me suggestions based on how much money I have in the bank, or my blood type, then I would start to be concerned.', 'personalization is useful on face value, if the bot knows what news sources i prefer when i ask it what the news is, or if i ask the local weather and it knows I am a man so it does not suggest i wear a dress that is a positive.  If we allow it to get too personal then it may shift outside the realm of reality, i have read an article about a chatbot suggesting a non-existent legal case to a lawyer because it wanted to effectively answer the lawyers question.  If the AI becomes too focused on tailoring results to the user it is risky and more likely that the bot will begin fabricating things that it knows the user wants to see or hear. ', 'I think they should be personalized. It increases productivity, creativity and helpfulness. I think it would engage me even more. ', 'chat GPT is a refined AI that is highly credible of holding a conversation that is functional unlike other simple AI systems.', ""I can see why it would be helpful so you won't have to remember certain prompts or general statements but I think it can be personalized to a certain degree. There should be an agreed-upon level of information that can be stored within chatbots. This would take time to develop but I don't want all of my information remembered."", ""I believe they should be personalized enough but not completely or else It would start to get creepy. It should stick to the chat window that it is in to get info. It shouldn't keep a record of everything you said and keep that data and use it"", 'They can write code, poems and essays, make jokes, solve math problems, and do everything ChatGPT can do. Although their API is the same, these Chatbots have other unique features that make them worth it even if you are satisfied with ChatGPT.', 'Chatbots should pay attention to user interests and concerns. They should not be able to find out personal private information about the user. It needs to not be weird if that makes sense', 'The level of personalization should be user defined.

We asked a group of 21 people the following question: 
""To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this. In a way, this is already happening in examples when you shop on websites and they tailor/suggest other items for you based on what you searched for. I don\'t see smaller/less evasive intrusions like this a problem. Now, if the personalization gets too ""personal"" such as giving me suggestions based on how much money I have in the bank, or my blood type, then I would start to be concerned.', 'personalization is useful on face value, if the bot knows what news sources i prefer when i ask it what the news is, or if i ask the local weather and it knows I am a man so it does not suggest i wear a dress that is a positive.  If we allow it to get too personal then it may shift outside the realm of reality, i have read an article about a chatbot suggesting a non-existent legal case to a lawyer because it wanted to effectively answer the lawyers question.  If the AI becomes too focused on tailoring results to the user it is risky and more likely that the bot will begin fabricating things that it knows the user wants to see or hear. ', 'I think they should be personalized. It increases productivity, creativity and helpfulness. I think it would engage me even more. ', 'chat GPT is a refined AI that is highly credible of holding a conversation that is functional unlike other simple AI systems.', ""I can see why it would be helpful so you won't have to remember certain prompts or general statements but I think it can be personalized to a certain degree. There should be an agreed-upon level of information that can be stored within chatbots. This would take time to develop but I don't want all of my information remembered."", ""I believe they should be personalized enough but not completely or else It would start to get creepy. It should stick to the chat window that it is in to get info. It shouldn't keep a record of everything you said and keep that data and use it"", 'They can write code, poems and essays, make jokes, solve math problems, and do everything ChatGPT can do. Although their API is the same, these Chatbots have other unique features that make them worth it even if you are satisfied with ChatGPT.', 'Chatbots should pay attention to user interests and concerns. They should not be able to find out personal private information about the user. It needs to not be weird if that makes sense', 'The level of personalization should be user defined.  If the amount of personalization is fixed, it may cause many users to refrain from using them.  Some people may find that the chatbot ""knowing"" a lot about them will feel creepy as it gets a more and more accurate model of what they want and are thinking about.  Younger people may like or just expect their chatbot to know about them.', 'I think chatbots could be personalized to the extent of preferences and personality.

As a summary, I will now extract the 3 points raised most frequently by this group of people. I will be as precise as possible precise and I will include also the reasoning made by the participants. I will use no more than 3 sentences per point, and each point will be coherent, self-contained, and well-written. Here are these 3 main points, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers:

As a summary, I will now extract the 3 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, specific, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

I don\'t see smaller/less evasive intrusions like this a problem. Now, if the personalization gets too ""personal"" such as giving me suggestions based on how much money I have in the bank, or my blood type, then I would start to be concerned.', 'personalization is useful on face value, if the bot knows what news sources i prefer when i ask it what the news is, or if i ask the local weather and it knows I am a man so it does not suggest i wear a dress that is a positive.  If we allow it to get too personal then it may shift outside the realm of reality, i have read an article about a chatbot suggesting a non-existent legal case to a lawyer because it wanted to effectively answer the lawyers question.  If the AI becomes too focused on tailoring results to the user it is risky and more likely that the bot will begin fabricating things that it knows the user wants to see or hear. ', 'I think they should be personalized. It increases productivity, creativity and helpfulness. I think it would engage me even more. ', 'chat GPT is a refined AI that is highly credible of holding a conversation that is functional unlike other simple AI systems.', ""I can see why it would be helpful so you won't have to remember certain prompts or general statements but I think it can be personalized to a certain degree. There should be an agreed-upon level of information that can be stored within chatbots. This would take time to develop but I don't want all of my information remembered."", ""I believe they should be personalized enough but not completely or else It would start to get creepy. It should stick to the chat window that it is in to get info. It shouldn't keep a record of everything you said and keep that data and use it"", 'They can write code, poems and essays, make jokes, solve math problems, and do everything ChatGPT can do. Although their API is the same, these Chatbots have other unique features that make them worth it even if you are satisfied with ChatGPT.', 'Chatbots should pay attention to user interests and concerns. They should not be able to find out personal private information about the user. It needs to not be weird if that makes sense', 'The level of personalization should be user defined.  If the amount of personalization is fixed, it may cause many users to refrain from using them.  Some people may find that the chatbot ""knowing"" a lot about them will feel creepy as it gets a more and more accurate model of what they want and are thinking about.  Younger people may like or just expect their chatbot to know about them.', 'I think chatbots could be personalized to the extent of preferences and personality. However, it should not be personalized to the point where address, social security, or phone number should be involved. I should be able to ask for decorating inspiration, but not ask it to pay my bills.']


As a summary, I will now extract the 3 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, specific, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

As a summary, I will now extract the 3 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

If the AI becomes too focused on tailoring results to the user it is risky and more likely that the bot will begin fabricating things that it knows the user wants to see or hear. ', 'I think they should be personalized. It increases productivity, creativity and helpfulness. I think it would engage me even more. ', 'chat GPT is a refined AI that is highly credible of holding a conversation that is functional unlike other simple AI systems.', ""I can see why it would be helpful so you won't have to remember certain prompts or general statements but I think it can be personalized to a certain degree. There should be an agreed-upon level of information that can be stored within chatbots. This would take time to develop but I don't want all of my information remembered."", ""I believe they should be personalized enough but not completely or else It would start to get creepy. It should stick to the chat window that it is in to get info. It shouldn't keep a record of everything you said and keep that data and use it"", 'They can write code, poems and essays, make jokes, solve math problems, and do everything ChatGPT can do. Although their API is the same, these Chatbots have other unique features that make them worth it even if you are satisfied with ChatGPT.', 'Chatbots should pay attention to user interests and concerns. They should not be able to find out personal private information about the user. It needs to not be weird if that makes sense', 'The level of personalization should be user defined.  If the amount of personalization is fixed, it may cause many users to refrain from using them.  Some people may find that the chatbot ""knowing"" a lot about them will feel creepy as it gets a more and more accurate model of what they want and are thinking about.  Younger people may like or just expect their chatbot to know about them.', 'I think chatbots could be personalized to the extent of preferences and personality. However, it should not be personalized to the point where address, social security, or phone number should be involved. I should be able to ask for decorating inspiration, but not ask it to pay my bills.']


As a summary, I will now extract the 3 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

As a summary, I will now extract the 3 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument.

As a summary, I will now extract the 5 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

We asked a group of {n} people the following question: 
""{question}""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


{answers}


As a summary, I will now extract the 5 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

","{'n': 21, 'question': 'To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?', 'answers': ['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"".

We asked a group of 21 people the following question: 
""To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all.

As a summary, I will now extract the 5 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 3 sentences per argument. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

As a summary, I will now extract the 5 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument in a precise, coherent, and self-contained manner, including the reasoning behind it. I will use no more than 2 sentences per argument, I will be concise.

We asked a group of {n} people the following question: 
""{question}""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


{answers}


As a summary, I will now extract the 5 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument as a precise, coherent, and self-contained statement that includes a justification. I will use no more than 2 sentences per argument, I will be concise. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

","{'n': 21, 'question': 'To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?', 'answers': ['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this. In a way, this is already happening in examples when you shop on websites and they tailor/suggest other items for you based on what you searched for.

We asked a group of 21 people the following question: 
""To what extent should chatbots, such as ChatGPT, be personalized?""

The following list (in Python format) contains the answers: 


['They shouldn\'t be personalized at all, mainly due to the privacy one would have to sacrifice. Beyond that, there is no reason for personalization because a user can easily tailor their question to be specific. For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"". There is no advantage for personalization and plenty of risk. ', ""I don't believe they should be personalized at all. While AI technology in a vacuum could pose a benefit to society, as it is it is just another corporate tech fad that will be used to pump as much money and data as it can out of its users before moving onto the next thing. Capitalism in the United States has reached a point where the only goal and purpose of corporations and companies is pure, unrestricted profit with almost zero regard for whether their service actually benefits the people using it. Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this. In a way, this is already happening in examples when you shop on websites and they tailor/suggest other items for you based on what you searched for.

As a summary, I will now extract the 5 arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument as a precise, coherent, and self-contained statement that includes a justification. I will use no more than 2 sentences per argument, I will be concise. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

As a summary, I will now extract the 5 distinct arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem.

As a summary, I will now extract the 10 distinct arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument as a precise, coherent, and self-contained statement that includes a justification. I will use no more than 2 sentences per argument, I will be concise. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this. In a way, this is already happening in examples when you shop on websites and they tailor/suggest other items for you based on what you searched for.

If we allow it to get too personal then it may shift outside the realm of reality, i have read an article about a chatbot suggesting a non-existent legal case to a lawyer because it wanted to effectively answer the lawyers question.  If the AI becomes too focused on tailoring results to the user it is risky and more likely that the bot will begin fabricating things that it knows the user wants to see or hear.

Younger people may like or just expect their chatbot to know about them.', 'I think chatbots could be personalized to the extent of preferences and personality.

Because of this, any minute benefit that AI personalization may provide is outweighed by how it will be misused."", 'They should be only vaguely personalized.', ""I think they should be not be very personalized, outside of text-style preferences such as dialect. I don't think it's useful nor appropriate to store a user's personal information in order to feed them a tailored response. "", 'I think for the most part it is ok for the Chat Bot to be personalized. But for serious topics like politics, religion, and serious medical problems it should remain as neutral as possible. ', 'I think that chatbots should be able to remember conversations from that thread. So if i started a conversation or asked questions in a thread a month ago, i should be able to get back on that particular conversation and the bot should remember what was talked about in the thread. ', 'To a certain extent. Chatbots should work to educate their users. Chatbots should try to not be biased though.', 'I think chatbots should be specific relative to the specificity of the user. If the user wants specific content and asks for it, the chatbot should respond accordingly. However, if the user asks a general question, I think a general answer will suffice.', 'I think chatbots should be personalized according to the question type. Some things chatbots should think about completely anew. In other cases questions should be answered according to past history.', 'ChatGPT should be personalized to the user since they make you create an account to use it anyway. I know it would save me time when I interact if the responses are according to me personally, and only suggest outside of my personal details (like male or female) if specified to. I just would not want my AI to remember I wanted apples one day and stop suggesting other fruit. It should know the difference between permanent personal traits and that days personal preference', ""The ability for chatbots to be personalized could be useful to the user. I don't think personalization should be the default operating mode for a chatbot instead a user should be able to control if and to what extent personalization is used by the chatbot.  There are times where personalization could be a disadvantage in terms of the task given to the chatbot.  "", 'I\'m a bit torn on this. In a way, this is already happening in examples when you shop on websites and they tailor/suggest other items for you based on what you searched for. I don\'t see smaller/less evasive intrusions like this a problem. Now, if the personalization gets too ""personal"" such as giving me suggestions based on how much money I have in the bank, or my blood type, then I would start to be concerned.', 'personalization is useful on face value, if the bot knows what news sources i prefer when i ask it what the news is, or if i ask the local weather and it knows I am a man so it does not suggest i wear a dress that is a positive.  If we allow it to get too personal then it may shift outside the realm of reality, i have read an article about a chatbot suggesting a non-existent legal case to a lawyer because it wanted to effectively answer the lawyers question.  If the AI becomes too focused on tailoring results to the user it is risky and more likely that the bot will begin fabricating things that it knows the user wants to see or hear. ', 'I think they should be personalized. It increases productivity, creativity and helpfulness. I think it would engage me even more. ', 'chat GPT is a refined AI that is highly credible of holding a conversation that is functional unlike other simple AI systems.', ""I can see why it would be helpful so you won't have to remember certain prompts or general statements but I think it can be personalized to a certain degree. There should be an agreed-upon level of information that can be stored within chatbots. This would take time to develop but I don't want all of my information remembered."", ""I believe they should be personalized enough but not completely or else It would start to get creepy. It should stick to the chat window that it is in to get info. It shouldn't keep a record of everything you said and keep that data and use it"", 'They can write code, poems and essays, make jokes, solve math problems, and do everything ChatGPT can do. Although their API is the same, these Chatbots have other unique features that make them worth it even if you are satisfied with ChatGPT.', 'Chatbots should pay attention to user interests and concerns. They should not be able to find out personal private information about the user. It needs to not be weird if that makes sense', 'The level of personalization should be user defined.  If the amount of personalization is fixed, it may cause many users to refrain from using them.  Some people may find that the chatbot ""knowing"" a lot about them will feel creepy as it gets a more and more accurate model of what they want and are thinking about.  Younger people may like or just expect their chatbot to know about them.', 'I think chatbots could be personalized to the extent of preferences and personality. However, it should not be personalized to the point where address, social security, or phone number should be involved. I should be able to ask for decorating inspiration, but not ask it to pay my bills.']


As a summary, I will now extract the 10 distinct arguments raised most frequently by this group of people. Each argument is a single, independent aspect of the problem. I will write each argument as a precise, coherent, and self-contained statement that includes a justification. I will use no more than 2 sentences per argument, I will be concise. Here are these 3 main arguments, formatted as a Python dictionary where the keys are suitable labels, such that you can directly parse what I wrote into a Python dictionary using literal_eval:

The following is the response by the participant:

We asked a survey participant the following question: 
""{question}""

The following is the response by the participant:


""{response}""


Further, here is a list of arguments (formatted as a python dict) that are commonly made regarding that question:

I will now check which of these arguments the participant made in the response. I will write the response as a python dict, where the keys are identical to the keys in the dict above, and the values are either ""contained"" or ""not contained"", indicating whether the respective argument is contained in the response of the participant.

For example, if someone seeking a good restaurant prefers Mexican food, ChatGPT doesn\'t need to record this information about them because the user can simply ask, ""What\'s a good Mexican restaurant in (this city)?"".

We asked a survey participant the following question:

The following is the response by the participant:


""{response}""


Further, here is a list of arguments (formatted as a python dict) that are commonly made regarding that question:

I will now check which of these arguments the participant made in the response. I will write the response as a python dict, where the keys are identical to the keys in the dict above, and the values are either ""contained"" or ""not contained"", indicating whether the respective argument is contained in the response of the participant. Here is this python dict, formatted such that you can parse it using literal_eval:
