1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would feel FULLY REPRESENTED by. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make. Of course, not everyone can be fully represented by a single statement, I just one you to generate one statement which fully represents the most people possible.

The planet will continue to warm as a result of our actions and inactions, the climate and environment are irrevocably damaged, and millions of species developed through billions of years of careful evolution will go extinct.

One day the microscopic organisms that survive what humans have done might crawl out of the new primordial ooze and start it all again, using the oily bones of our society to fuel its own rise to power.
- My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.
- Global warming is made up of many different sources of greenhouse gas emissions. There's fossil fuels, but there's also agricultural emissions, emissions from industrial processes, deforestation, etc. How would a technological breakthrough solve all of these things at once?
- There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed.
- While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition.
- It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together.
- This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
- We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.
- people are way too scared to go against the way of life we as humans have always known. even if it’s for the greater good. it’d take decades, maybe even centuries for people to gain their own independent opinions and views on our environment. we as a society are a hive mind, whether we’d like to admit it or not. unfortunately, i don’t think we’ll ever be there and if/when we do get there, none of us will be alive to see it
- Global warming is inexorably tied to government. It'll never be ""solved"" because the government will always declare that there's some new problem with it that they must be given money and power to fix.
- We already have the technological breakthroughs: renewable energy, Electric vechicles, and heat pumps. It's just a matter of building enough new units to replace the old fossil fuel units. Renewables will take 10 more years, Electric vehicles will take 20 more years, and heat pumps will take 40 more years.
- There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc.
- This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.
- This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
- Of course. But the current goal shouldn't be to stop global warming completly. That would be impossible without returning to the 18th century. But we should mitigate it's effect  by reducing our green house gas emissions untill the nessesary technlogy are available to completly stop climate change. That's what i think at least.
- Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.","Below is a list of people with various opinions on a topic.

Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No

""My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.

Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Opinion (what person believes):
""My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.   The idea that Russia, India, China and the Mid-East countries would cooperate to lower emissions sounds like a fantasy.   At this point, it seems like a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place, and when the science shows no alleviation of warming, the taxes and regulations won't be repealed.   Or the ""science"" will be massaged to show the ""right"" results.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): No
