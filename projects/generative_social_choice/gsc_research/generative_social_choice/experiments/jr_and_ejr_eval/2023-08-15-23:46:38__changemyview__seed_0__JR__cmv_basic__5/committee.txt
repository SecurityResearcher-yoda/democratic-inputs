{'Addressing global warming requires a combination of existing technology implementation, systemic transformation in our economic and social structures, and fostering cooperation among nations. Small incremental changes and individual efforts should not be dismissed, as they contribute to the collective impact and buy us time to develop and implement innovative solutions. However, we must also recognize the substantial challenges ahead and the possibility that a breakthrough alone may not guarantee a complete resolution to climate change.': [9190153, 61145487, 61489654, 95362406, 29257320, 37286383, 76748472, 65022757, 49466974, 95482972], 'Global warming might not be solved within our lifetime due to a combination of political manipulation and our inherent resistance to change. While we have some technological advancements that could help, widespread implementation and international cooperation seem unlikely. It is possible that only a massive technological breakthrough or a significant shift in societal mindset could alter the trajectory of climate change.': [9190153, 28312389, 91782895, 61145487, 30520126, 61489654, 95362406, 29257320, 37286383, 20928113, 76748472, 49466974], '"Global warming is a daunting issue that we might not fully solve, due to our actions and inactions causing irrevocable damage and potential extinctions.
