- If the state cannot provide good retirement benefits to KRS employees, the county/city should supplement the retirement with a 401k.
- Wal-Mart and Kroger grocery pick-up should have to accept EBT for the elderly and disabled
- City should bar non-competes, similar to North Dakota/California, as driving destitution in non-tenure work force. Be heroic destination.
- Need new schools in Warren County to keep up with population growth, CTE is falling down, Drakes and Greenwood high are way overcrowded
- Older apartment complexes deteriorate.  Creates blighted areas, crime increases.  Stricter Landlord/Tenant rules needed!
- We need mixed-use development in the most disadvantaged areas of BG.
- Our sidewalks need more connectivity. It's too piecemealed and makes some areas unusable.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.

            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic.

- Plan for people, not cars. Walking should be enjoyable, not a hazard.
- Individuals should be treated equally. Higher positions or who you work for should not release anyone from responsibility of their actions.","Below is a list of people with various opinions on a topic. Follow the following steps: 
            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd.

            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.
