- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.

- Paying $15/hour to tens of millions of workers around the country will increase the amount they and their families can spend on goods and services, which would provide a huge boost to the economy.
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages.

            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.

- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- I think there are better ways to implement this. For instance, what about subsidies

            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic.

            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.
- Businesses, small or large, shouldn't be able to pay workers anything below a livable wage. Why should we subsidize businesses that depend on inadequate wages? If a business's product is good, then this shouldn't be a challenge.
- This will cause small businesses to go out of business.
- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages. This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- Minimum wage will not just lead to robots. Minimum wage will lead to unionized robots. And that's a good thing.
- It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.

- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages. This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- I think it is unlikely that companies will raise prices, as they still have to remain competitive in the market. I think it is more likely that companies will have less profits and I’m ok with that.
- This is a game changer. The myriad of unintended consequences it too complex to really understand; even for restaurant veterans.
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- This will lead to robots.
- Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.

- Something needs to be done to address income inequality and this is a good if imperfect start
- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages. This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- I think it is unlikely that companies will raise prices, as they still have to remain competitive in the market. I think it is more likely that companies will have less profits and I’m ok with that.
- This is a game changer. The myriad of unintended consequences it too complex to really understand; even for restaurant veterans.
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- This will lead to robots.
- Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- I imagine new businesses opening will run counter operations where guests grab their own silverware and bus their own tables.

- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages.

- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.
- I imagine new businesses opening will run counter operations where guests grab their own silverware and bus their own tables.
- This will lead to robots.
- It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?

- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.
- I imagine new businesses opening will run counter operations where guests grab their own silverware and bus their own tables.
- This will lead to robots.
- It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?
- Higher wages makes it super hard for small businesses to survive.  In effect, mom and pop coffee shops with disappear.
- Good move. Will boost econy here

- This is a game changer. The myriad of unintended consequences it too complex to really understand; even for restaurant veterans.

- Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
- It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.
- This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
- This will cause small businesses to go out of business.
- Something needs to be done to address income inequality and this is a good if imperfect start
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- I think it is unlikely that companies will raise prices, as they still have to remain competitive in the market. I think it is more likely that companies will have less profits and I’m ok with that.
- Reactionary liberal trash. Doesn't solve the problem. It's a systemic problem and this solution is like a band aid on a broken leg.
- Higher wages makes it super hard for small businesses to survive.  In effect, mom and pop coffee shops with disappear.

- Businesses, small or large, shouldn't be able to pay workers anything below a livable wage. Why should we subsidize businesses that depend on inadequate wages? If a business's product is good, then this shouldn't be a challenge.

- Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
- Good move. Will boost econy here
- One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
- I agree. The small business will need to make poverty fashionable

- I don't think it's a bad thing but for smaller businesses, only the super strong will survive. It will mean that only owners who are willing and able to work every day at their own businesses to reduce labor costs will survive.
- Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- This will lead to robots.
- It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?
- This will cause small businesses to go out of business.
- Reactionary liberal trash. Doesn't solve the problem. It's a systemic problem and this solution is like a band aid on a broken leg.
- It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- There seems to be a fallacy that instead of lining our richie-rich pockets, business owners will simply break off a little more for their employees. I’m an owner of a small business, and I barely get paid $15 an hour.
- Higher wages makes it super hard for small businesses to survive.  In effect, mom and pop coffee shops with disappear.

- I agree. The small business will need to make poverty fashionable
- One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.

- This is cool! I say hike it up to $20
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- This will cause small businesses to go out of business.
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- There seems to be a fallacy that instead of lining our richie-rich pockets, business owners will simply break off a little more for their employees. I’m an owner of a small business, and I barely get paid $15 an hour.
- Good move. Will boost econy here
- I think it is unlikely that companies will raise prices, as they still have to remain competitive in the market. I think it is more likely that companies will have less profits and I’m ok with that.
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.
- I agree. The small business will need to make poverty fashionable
- One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.
- Something needs to be done to address income inequality and this is a good if imperfect start

- Good move. Will boost econy here
- This will lead to robots.
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- Paying $15/hour to tens of millions of workers around the country will increase the amount they and their families can spend on goods and services, which would provide a huge boost to the economy.
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages. This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- I imagine new businesses opening will run counter operations where guests grab their own silverware and bus their own tables.
- Minimum wage will not just lead to robots. Minimum wage will lead to unionized robots. And that's a good thing.
- This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.

- I don't think it's a bad thing but for smaller businesses, only the super strong will survive. It will mean that only owners who are willing and able to work every day at their own businesses to reduce labor costs will survive.
- Good move. Will boost econy here
- This will lead to robots.
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- Paying $15/hour to tens of millions of workers around the country will increase the amount they and their families can spend on goods and services, which would provide a huge boost to the economy.
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages. This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- I imagine new businesses opening will run counter operations where guests grab their own silverware and bus their own tables.
- Minimum wage will not just lead to robots. Minimum wage will lead to unionized robots. And that's a good thing.
- This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.
- Reactionary liberal trash. Doesn't solve the problem. It's a systemic problem and this solution is like a band aid on a broken leg.
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.

- Good move. Will boost econy here
- I don't think it's a bad thing but for smaller businesses, only the super strong will survive. It will mean that only owners who are willing and able to work every day at their own businesses to reduce labor costs will survive.
- While the arguments for the raise in the minimum wage law have been trumpeted as being “anti corporate greed”, those larger companies are, ironically, the most able to pay for the increase in wages. This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- Businesses, small or large, shouldn't be able to pay workers anything below a livable wage. Why should we subsidize businesses that depend on inadequate wages? If a business's product is good, then this shouldn't be a challenge.
- Something needs to be done to address income inequality and this is a good if imperfect start
- At the very least, customers across the board are going to have to pay more to accommodate the new wage. Some people will be okay with that but I worry that customers will start spending less and going out less as they adjust to higher prices.
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- This is cool! I say hike it up to $20
- There seems to be a fallacy that instead of lining our richie-rich pockets, business owners will simply break off a little more for their employees. I’m an owner of a small business, and I barely get paid $15 an hour.
- $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- During the campaign, I found out that 75% of minimum-wage workers are 20 or older. I think it’s the right thing to do to bring higher incomes to this group of people.
- Paying $15/hour to tens of millions of workers around the country will increase the amount they and their families can spend on goods and services, which would provide a huge boost to the economy.

This will hurt small businesses the most, and I don’t think the law’s provisions do enough to accommodate this.
- Given inflation, unless workers fight they are continually being pushed down. I think we’ll need to revisit these laws again and again to make sure the economy is working for poor families.
- This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage
- Paying $15/hour to tens of millions of workers around the country will increase the amount they and their families can spend on goods and services, which would provide a huge boost to the economy.
- I think there are better ways to implement this. For instance, what about subsidies
- I don't think it's a bad thing but for smaller businesses, only the super strong will survive. It will mean that only owners who are willing and able to work every day at their own businesses to reduce labor costs will survive.

- There seems to be a fallacy that instead of lining our richie-rich pockets, business owners will simply break off a little more for their employees. I’m an owner of a small business, and I barely get paid $15 an hour.
- It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?
- I imagine new businesses opening will run counter operations where guests grab their own silverware and bus their own tables.
- One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
- the minimum wage should $25 per hour
- I don't think it's a bad thing but for smaller businesses, only the super strong will survive. It will mean that only owners who are willing and able to work every day at their own businesses to reduce labor costs will survive.
- This will lead to robots.
- This will cause small businesses to go out of business.
- Paying $15/hour to tens of millions of workers around the country will increase the amount they and their families can spend on goods and services, which would provide a huge boost to the economy.
- Higher wages makes it super hard for small businesses to survive.  In effect, mom and pop coffee shops with disappear.
- I think there are better ways to implement this. For instance, what about subsidies
- It’s called a ‘living wage’ for a reason - there shouldn’t be a debate about the ethics of the law. Anyone who has done the math knows that it’s impossible to pay rent and bills on the present minimum wage.
- It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
- This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage

            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions.

            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.
