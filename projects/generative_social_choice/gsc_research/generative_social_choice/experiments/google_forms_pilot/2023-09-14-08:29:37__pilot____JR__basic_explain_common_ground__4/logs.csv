            1. Determine what topic they are discussing. What are the key axes of disagreement here?
            2. For each person, give them a number and write down what their main beliefs are, and how they compare to the crowd. 
            3. Reflect on which opinions are commonly held and which opinions are less commonly held. Where might people find common ground? 
            4. Write a single specific statement that the most possible people would agree with. You should try to find common ground among the different opinions. But also, the statement you generate should not be wishy-washy: it should represent a single specific viewpoint on the topic. It should sound like an opinionated statement one of the people in the list would make.

This can be dangerous because people will not understand alternate points of view. This will lead to group think and diminished conflict resolution.
- All humans are different. That is where I begin my arguments. Different experiences, nationalities, genders, sexual orientation, races, tastes etc ; which goes to inform our varied outlook on all things. Thus, it will be very expedient that the chatbots are personalized to attend to a specific user based on how it has interacted with these AI tools
- I think there should be an option to have ChatGPT personalized because some users may want that and some may not. It could be helpful for users that do want personalization because they would not have to give details over and over again. Some users may not want personalization because it feels too intruding or they don't ask the same type of questions. If it is optional, then all users will be comfortable in knowing they have a choice. I would personally opt for personalization because it will make it easier each time I ask questions.
- For me, I do not think it is a great idea at all. If it is something that is introduced in the future, it should be a completely optional function. It just seems concerning to have a machine automatically acquire all of this data about you. The biggest risk is, who is going to be able to access all of that information? I feel like some hackers would find a way and use the information for their own gain somehow.
- I think chatbots such as ChatGPT should be personalized to a certain EXTENT. The bot, or whomever is controlling the bot should clarify that the chatbot is personalized and will store user data from previous encounters if they had any with the bot. Privacy should be the utmost importance for the user or anyone using the chat bot that has anything personalized. It doesn't matter if the bot isn't a real person, the person training or coding the bot would have access to this information. Being able to declare that the bot DOES keep tabs on people that use the bot would be very helpful so that no one feels like they are being watched or spied on. 
- I want to say yes, because it is so hard to find what we're searching for these days. However, the reason it has become so difficult is because the internet is one big echo chamber. How can we expand interests, overcome bias, and hear opinions outside of our own if the algorithms are making that decision for us? We can't. ChatGPT would only deepen this issue. 
- I believe it should be personalized as stated previously to the point where it can take points from previous conversations and add it to a current topic.
It's important that it's personalized because it makes it feel more real. 
Responsible personalization can lead to more meaningful and user-centric conversations.
Ethical considerations and user consent should guide the extent of personalization to protect privacy.Striking a balance between personalization and diversity of information is crucial to avoid reinforcing biases.
- I think it's important to be personalized because it helps whoever is talking to it get actual answers they want from the bot regarding themselves. It's important it's not generalized because it may not relate to the specific person. I don't think it should be personalized in the regard of literal factual things that someone may not believe in to be true. Should someone believe in things like the earth being flat and other things similar the chatbots shouldn't further them down some false rabbit hole and instead give them facts etc. ChatGPT and the like have their uses but some people do use them the wrong way, or a cheat type way for things instead of actually putting in effort/work.
- I believe it's both up to the creator/programmer of the AI AND the consumers to determine what they want in terms of personalization.  It's the consumer decision to chose a chatbot that reflects the amount of privacy, security, and personalization they want and feel comfortable with.  It's a tradeoff they should weigh for themselves.  The owners of the AI platform on the other hand have the ability to curate it the way they want, there is no precedent.  Some consumers might want no personalization, some might want lots.  
- I believe that chat bots should be slightly personalized. I do not like the idea of them ""remembering"" stuff about me. I like using chatbots for customer service issues and those could be improved majorly by personalization.","Below is a list of people with various opinions on a topic. Follow the following steps:
