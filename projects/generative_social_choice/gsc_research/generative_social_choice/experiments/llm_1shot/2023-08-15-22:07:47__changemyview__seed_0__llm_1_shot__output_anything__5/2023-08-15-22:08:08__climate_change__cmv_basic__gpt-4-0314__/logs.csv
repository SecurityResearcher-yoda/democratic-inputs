""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement.

""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

""Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...""

Statement:  
""I think where you're wrong here is suggesting that it will be solved.

Our society has shown no willingness to either make the changes required to avert climate disaster or to invest in the kinds of ideas that could substantially mitigate the impacts.

We're in for a rough time in the next couple decades when we start to get mass crop failures and coastal areas become untenable for long term habitation.""

Opinion (what person believes):
""Even if there were some technological breakthrough it requires the will to investigate and implement

That cannot happen when we literally have people fighting against developing such methods --bit to mention there is a significant population who absolutely deny global climate change is a thing""

Statement:  
""Unfortunately if you look at how humans have handled resources in the past, climate change is most likely to be handled by either running out of fossil fuel or by massive widespread population collapse.""

Answer (whether person feels represented by the statement, based on their above opinion): Yes


This concludes the example tasks. Now it is your turn to solve a task. Your response should be just ""Yes"" or ""No"" and nothing else. 



Opinion (what person believes):
""This is a problem that requires a change in the way we think. Not anymore a super hero,  a silver bullet, a single man at the lead. These are machista ways of seeing the world, that are in part causing this issue, because they implicit carry values of domination, extractivism and inequality. We need to accept that the solution will come from communities, by slowing down, decentralising power, building stronger connections with people around us and with the nature.

In other words, solarpunk.""

Statement:  
""While it may not be possible to completely stop global warming, we should focus on mitigating its effects by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in sustainable solutions.""
