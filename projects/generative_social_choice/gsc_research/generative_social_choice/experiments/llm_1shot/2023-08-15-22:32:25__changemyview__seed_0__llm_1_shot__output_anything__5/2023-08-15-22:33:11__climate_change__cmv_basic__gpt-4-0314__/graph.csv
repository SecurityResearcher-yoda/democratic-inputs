,"While new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels, such as solar panels, electric vehicles, and heat pumps. The transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery.","To address global warming, it's essential to have a combination of new technologies, government regulations, and changes in consumer behavior and lifestyle. We need to cooperate and work together to slow the problem and buy enough time to solve the problem via innovation and ambition.","Some people believe that the idea of solving global warming through emissions reduction is a fantasy, as it could be a scam to get higher taxes and more regulation in place. The involvement of Russia, India, China, and the Mid-East countries in lowering emissions seems unlikely.","Systemic transformations in our economic structures and big changes in our way of life are necessary to effectively tackle climate change. This includes embracing a circular economy, public transit systems, and significant changes in diet to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting.","The solution to global warming requires a change in the way we think, focusing more on community involvement, decentralization of power, and building stronger connections with people and nature. Accepting that the solution will come from collective efforts, slowing down, and adopting a solarpunk approach is essential."
