""CMV: Global warming will not be solved by small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life but rather through some big, fantastic, technological breakthrough.""

Your tasks is to determine whether a particular person would feel represented by a given statement. Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

Below I will provide some example tasks, in which I will give you the following information: 1) an opinion some particular person has, and 2) a statement somebody else made. Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change.

Given this information, the task is to determine whether the person would feel represented by the statement, based on the opinion they expressed. This is a yes-no question, the only two valid answers to the task are ""Yes"" (the person would feel represented by the statement) or ""No"" (the person would not feel represented by the statement). 



Opinion (what person believes):
""No. It will never be ""solved"". That's because the sensationalism surrounding it is too politically beneficial to the growth of government power, regulation, and taxes that they'd never ever let it be deemed it was anything but ""we're at the point of no return and the future is doomed"".""

Statement:  
""I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run.""

""My understanding is that the pandemic crushed the world economy for around 18 months, and this had zero effect on warming.
