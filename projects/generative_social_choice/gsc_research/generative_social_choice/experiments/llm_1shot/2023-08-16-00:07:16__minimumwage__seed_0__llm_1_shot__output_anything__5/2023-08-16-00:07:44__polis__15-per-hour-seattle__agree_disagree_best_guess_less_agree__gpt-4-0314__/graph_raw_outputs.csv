,"Businesses, small or large, shouldn't be able to pay workers anything below a livable wage. Why should we subsidize businesses that depend on inadequate wages? If a business's product is good, then this shouldn't be a challenge.",It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.,This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage,$15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.,Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
