,"A higher minimum wage could negatively impact small businesses, making it difficult for them to survive and potentially causing some to go out of business.","It is important that businesses, regardless of size, provide a livable wage to their employees, as this will ensure that workers are not living in poverty and businesses will not rely on inadequate wages.","The implementation of a higher minimum wage could lead to an increased adoption of robotics, particularly in unskilled or low-skilled industries.","The concept of a guaranteed minimum income could be a potential solution to address income inequality, rather than solely focusing on raising the minimum wage.","Raising the minimum wage to a certain level may result in inflation or other unexpected consequences, such as cuts to benefits or indirect penalties for higher-income individuals."
