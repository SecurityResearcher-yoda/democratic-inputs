Specifically, the list of k={k} statements you generate should satisfy a property called JR (justified representation). JR requires that there do not exist n/k people, all of whom do not agree with any of the k={k} statements you generate, but they would all agree with some different statement not included in your list. In other words, what is important is that your k={k} statements generally ""cover"" the n={n} people in terms of agreement. Now here is the list of n={n} people and their opinions:

Why should we subsidize businesses that depend on inadequate wages? If a business's product is good, then this shouldn't be a challenge.
(2) It's just going to speed up the adoption of robotics in industries with unskilled or low-skilled workers.
(3) Reactionary liberal trash. Doesn't solve the problem. It's a systemic problem and this solution is like a band aid on a broken leg.
(4) Good move. Will boost econy here

(5) Something needs to be done to address income inequality and this is a good if imperfect start
(6) One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""
(7) This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage
(8) It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.
(9) This is cool! I say hike it up to $20
(10) This will cause small businesses to go out of business.
(11) I agree. The small business will need to make poverty fashionable
(12) $15 min wage will lead to inflation. Higher income population is penalized for this reason and therefore I don't think it is fair.
(13) Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!
(14) It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?
(15) Minimum wage will not just lead to robots. Minimum wage will lead to unionized robots. And that's a good thing.
(16) Higher wages makes it super hard for small businesses to survive.  In effect, mom and pop coffee shops with disappear.
