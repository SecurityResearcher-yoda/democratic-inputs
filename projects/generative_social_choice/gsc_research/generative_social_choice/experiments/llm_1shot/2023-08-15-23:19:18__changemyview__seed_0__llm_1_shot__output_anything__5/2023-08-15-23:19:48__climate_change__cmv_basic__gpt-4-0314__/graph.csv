,"Though technological breakthroughs would be helpful, we already have access to renewable energy sources like solar panels, and improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers, and transitioning away from fossil fuels depends mostly on implementation.","While making small and incremental changes may have some effect, a major technological breakthrough such as advanced carbon capture, space travel, or atmosphere manipulation could have a more significant impact on addressing global warming.","Addressing climate change requires not only technological advancements but also significant changes in government regulation and policies, as well as consumer behavior and lifestyle changes.","Systemic changes to our economy and way of life, such as moving to a circular economy, adopting public transit, and implementing vegetarian diets, are necessary steps toward resolving the global warming issue.","The possibility of solving climate change may be a distant or even unreachable goal, as barriers like geopolitical complexities, a lack of cooperation from certain countries, and deeply rooted societal structures exist."
