jts1kgg,yyzjertl,197,This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.
jtsi226,DreamingSilverDreams,104,"I think what you are suggesting is ultimately 'sciencing our way out of climate change' and this is unlikely to work because we are running out of time.

Scientific breakthroughs will happen, there is no doubt about it. However, it may take years to test, optimise, commercialise, and implement new technologies and solutions. It took almost a century for modern solar and wind technologies to mature: Both initially appeared at the end of the 19th century (1880s).

The first breakthrough in nuclear fusion happened last year in December. It was a 5s experiment that produced a tiny bit of surplus energy. When the fusion technology is ready for commercialisation/widespread use, climate change will be irreversible and impossible to mitigate if we continue business-as-usual and hope to solve everything with nuclear fusion.

There were zero experiments on changing the Earth's albedo (your glitter in the troposphere) and no one knows or can predict with a high degree of certainty what will happen even in the short term. I am not sure it is a good idea to hope for the best and just roll the dice.

CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is currently commercially unviable and requires changes in regulations to become viable. There are also concerns about possible leaks. CCS would also require large investments in its infrastructure (scrubbers, pipes, storage, etc.). Most importantly, this technology does not address the source of the problem, it only deals with the symptoms and can potentially promote further increases in CO2 emissions.

As for small changes in consumer behaviours, I think they will not work, too. They are too small.

Most scientific papers I read suggest that the best way (if not the only way) to mitigate climate change (at this point no one talks about reversing it) is through swift and radical changes in regulations. Governments need to take action because only they have the power to force changes on a global scale.

EDIT: u/HughJazzKok in the comments points out that the nuclear fusion experiment resulted in some excess energy, but the net energy in the entire system is not surplus. If it is the case (I am not a physicist and have to rely on newspaper reporting), we are even further from the practical implementation than I originally thought."
jts29fc,Brakasus,43,">Seriously, does anyone actually think this will fix things?

Yes.

>I mean to say that small changes to be more environmentally friendly such as buying a hybrid vehicle or eating less meat are next to useless.

Electric vehicles themselves don't change anything. In combination with solar and wind energy this story changes, though. Both, EVs and renewable energies have seen steady marginal growth. It'd ease my mind if the growth was more vigorous, but it is growing and improving at least and it creates an economical alternative to the current status quo thats fossil energy. Technological change in history always followed this slow marginal growth pattern, as well. The industrial revolution took hundreds of years and we still saw the highest amounts of growth in the last decades, meaning it isn't done yet.

If anything, its exactly the reluctance to embrace this -marginal but hard- path, which you show here in your approach that is very common among most people, which seriously holds politics back from more quickly phasing out environmentally harmful technologies. Because, what if some technology comes around the corner that makes driving cars ok, again? Then all this change was for nothing, right?

Well, historically speaking at least, nothing like this has ever happened. The real difficulty in quickly changing the world lies in quickly changing humans, which is impossible. Case in point, we have two incredibly efficient means of transportation that have actually been phased out of use in the last 70 years: The bike and the train. Humans are super efficient when it comes to movement and putting a human on a bike on a road is litteral efficiency heaven, nothing compares. Conversely, if you do want to go faster than by bike, and boats are still too slow for you, then the next most efficient mode is the train, since it leverages the efficiencies that come from moving many people at once and it takes advantage of most people traveling between the same places anyway. So here is my question back to you, why isn't the western world filled to the brim with these two killer technologies which are clearly superior to car and plane in the majority of cases and which go a long way in stopping climate change?"
jtrzs9j,FaerieStories,45,"> I mean to say that small changes to be more environmentally friendly such as buying a hybrid vehicle or eating less meat are next to useless. Seriously, does anyone actually think this will fix things?

No, a ""big fantastic technological breakthrough"" is not going to be what solves climate change, biodiversity loss andd habitat destruction, the depletion of our topsoil, the death of our coral reefs or deal with 40°C ocean temperatures. 

The only way to turn this shit around is for people to re-define what a good quality of life is. We can't be mindless consumers anymore. Our society is structured completely wrong. 

The reality is there isn't a solution the majority is ever going to agree on and well run this ship right into the ground. This should have been mainstream news 20-30 years ago and anytime a politican comes around that actually focuses on the climate, arguably the **only** thing that matters right now, the people either don't vote for them or they get screwed by corruption."
jts0i4o,Jebofkerbin,27,"We have the technology to go net zero now, it's just a case of money, infrastructure, and political will. The idea that some brilliant breakthrough in tech will save us is a dream of people who don't want any solution that challenges the status quo. For example a ban on ICE vehicles and a reduction in the number personal vehicles on the road is something that is almost definitely necessary to reduce our emissions, but people really hate the idea of losing their gas guzzling truck so they are attracted to a future where they can keep living exactly as they are but the clouds are sparkly or whatever."
jts24ls,OptimisticRealist__,14,"Its both.

On one hand people need to change their lifestyles. Less meat consumption, not buying new clothes every other day, take public transport or walk, no cruises etc.

Just look at the US - the US is incredibly wasteful with its hyperconsumerism, on a per capita basis (obviously a more meaningful metric) the US is a bigger pollutor than China and India combined. 

At the same time, we need a moonshot tech, something along the lines of carbon capture, to be able to not make climate change worse"
jts1ee2,tipoima,11,"All the ""fantastic technological breakthroughs"" are just bandaids that only delay the issue instead of solving it (while also encouraging the same kind of emissions that caused the problem).   
The real way to solve climate change is to just stop consuming 60%-70% of our energy demand. Except that would pretty much end all cars, butcher industry and agriculture, make consumer goods obscenely expensive, e.t.c. And no country would agree to subject itself to that, much less the entire world.  
I believe we will not solve global warming. Billions will be displaced and die in the next century or two. Human civilization will massively shrink. And then maybe their emissions will be small enough so they can actually solve it without waiting for millions of years of natural processes."
jtryr2v,_Dnikeb,7,You want to blast glitter in the troposphere? what?
jtsdlgg,Agentbasedmodel,8,"There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. 

What is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.

From throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.

Hybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. 

Eating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. 

Etc."
jts30o6,poprostumort,7,">In regards to the former, I mean to say that small changes to be more environmentally friendly such as buying a hybrid vehicle or eating less meat are next to useless. Seriously, does anyone actually think this will fix things?

Of course it's what solves the issue, because that is what is always solving the issues - small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life that prompt more study into these avenues, more small, piecemeal, incremental technological changes - all of that will add up into an actual breakthrough. Breakthrough that will not be a one big tech that solves the problem, but a plethora of small changes and techs that would solve the issue.

If you buy a hybrid vehicles, there is market for them. So companies need to invest in hybrids/EV and tech around it to make a more compelling hybrid/EV for people to buy. This leads to R&D funding and more incremental changes - until you come to a point where electric motor and batteries are good enough to power ANY vehicle. At that market pursuing selling EV cars made enough tech changes that  electric motor can be used in major polluters - electric trucks, electric ships, electric planes. And they will be powered by renewable energy as competition in that sector is doing the same - making costs og generating energy lower and lower. 

>And by ‘big technological breakthrough’ I mean something along the lines of blasting glitter into the troposphere to block out the sun or using fusion power to scrub carbon out of the air to later be buried underground. We are the human race and we’re nothing if not flexible and adaptable when push comes to shove.

You know that in human history issues were rarely, if ever, resolved by a big technological breakthrough. They were solved by someone inventing new way of doing X that was less capable but promising, people investing into it and tech slowly getting better and better until old way that was problematic was dropped because it was obsolete.

Can you name any issue that was resolved by sudden breakthrough?"
jtrzgw3,Z7-852,5,"World biggest polluters are fossil fuel industry, agriculture and fashion. All these industries are profit driven entities. They are not polluting because it's fun or they are evil. They are doing it because it makes them bank.

jtsjirv,Moraulf232,3,You’re wrong. Global warming will not be solved but endured.
jtrz3xq,togtogtog,2,"We already know how to prevent global warming. However, we, as an entire species, find it impossible to act in unison, or to behave in ways which work in the longer term.

I agree with you that leaving it to individual people will not work, because there will always be plenty of people who won't take individual action.

However, it's also perfectly possible to bring about change through changing regulation, and this has been done in the past to good effect with all sorts of things which are harmful to the environment (CFCs, excrement, DDT)

Rather than allowing global warming to make the planet uninhabitable in some regions and far less pleasant in others while waiting for a technological breakthrough which may or may not work, it would be far more logical to change regulations. Therefore, lobbying and political action is an effective place for individuals to take action.

We *are* the human race, and therefore we already know that although we are flexible and adaptable, we aren't that logical or far sighted, in particular when we act as large groups (hell, even as small groups!)."
jtsizar,explain_that_shit,2,"It will cost far less money and diplomatic issues to just convert to a carbon neutral global economy than to moonshot some untested new toy to screw with the climate in some new way. Not to mention that that expensive toy will not sustainably solve the problem, if it solves the problem at all (rather than just creating its own, new problems).

We have the technology to solve the problem. Ignoring that technology in favour of some imaginary new technology just sounds like a child bored with their toys and wanting a new toy for the novelty. ‘Technologists’ need to grow up and get on board with the solutions on the table, because we simply do not have the time for this kind of screwing around."
jtsrebs,PrometheusHasFallen,2,"Energy transition expert here...

I suppose it really depends on what you consider a technological breakthrough and what is just incremental improvements to existing technology.

For electricity, I think the technology is there (or getting there) to use solar and wind with stationary battery storage with some small modular nuclear reactors and peaker natural gas plants to guarantee reliability. Perhaps not 100% decarbonized by close enough.

For transportation, I think lithium-ion batteries can be used in a lot of lighter vehicle use cases. But I think this is more limited and subject to consumer resistance than what a lot of advocates would tell you. Perhaps each private home in the U.S. will have one BEV and one non-BEV vehicle. That's probably the maximum market penetration we'll see in the U.S. in my opinion.

For the remaining transportation use cases and for decarbonizing heavy industry and residential and commercial heating, I really think low-carbon hydrogen will be the key source of energy, either in its natural form or as a derivative like ammonia or methanol. Hydrogen costs are tied to renewable power and natural gas costs and there is a TON of investment going on right now to make it competitive vs. diesel and gasoline. And I think it will be by the 2030s.

Lastly, we do have pretty serious investment and technology in the realm of carbon capture and electrification of technologies. Maybe direct air capture is a ways off but at least in certain locations that have abundant geothermal energy like in Iceland, they could just keep on sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere indefinitely. But the vast majority of carbon capture will be on concentrated emissions sources at industrial facilities. The technology is there. It just costs money and needs to get past the NIMBYism."
jtt4pxq,DSMBCA,2,"I agree with you on this.  With all the targets we have set globally it's really just lip service in the grand scheme of things.  The countries that matter in Asia and Africa with the largest populations as their wealth increases they want the quality of life we have enjoyed in the west.  They don't really give a rip about climate targets - if we decimate our economy to save the world they are just going to steam roll us and carry on with the status quo!  

That being said I don't think we should do nothing - it's important to invest and INNOVATE in clean technologies. With AI there is some risk but I think there is a lot of potential when you literally have infinite intelligence.  I don't think we comprehend what that means for humanity."
jttn1jg,Lucosis,2,"We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.

The path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem."
jtto6tx,Redwolf193,2,"Agree with first half, second half I don’t. All the technology to help mitigate climate change and become carbon neutral already exists, it’s just a matter of actually deploying it to scale and refining it. Nuclear, wind, solar. The tech necessary to provide energy for our world already exists, and only needs finite tuning and deployment. We are already looking into gene editing a species of poisonous peas by removing the toxic aspect and making it safe for consumption. This particular plant reinvigorates the soil and is extremely resilient. If the poison aspect can be removed, it can easily become a staple food source for the world even if things do go tits up. All the technology to save society and then some already exists, the problem is sociological in nature. It requires some fundamental changes to society and our role on the planet as a whole, as well as some temporary discomfort in the interim as we transition. Oil companies need to be held accountable too, as they knew the risks since the 80s but kept things business as usual despite that, even actively pushing out/funding disinformation (sort of like how the cigarette companies used to do). I don’t think there is any tech breakthrough that could be made that can fix this, it requires getting people, politicians, and businesses all on board unfortunately. I think it can be done, but it definitely isn’t going to be easy"

* Single use goods in general should be heavily taxed, to the point where it is cheaper to buy durable and repairable alternatives.
* International trade agreements on private consumption goods should be revoked. Protectionists custom duties should be implemented.
* Companies should be forced to manufacture in the market where they sell, like it is done in Brazil or India (through salty import fees on finished goods) or in China.

The big -but- is that this line of thought ignores the domino affect those small changes have on the economy and evolution of green living and energy. We made slingshots before we made interplanetary vehicles. We need the economy and support starting with small business startups before we can have the economy and support for a planetary wide cleanup and green energy network.

We currently have the technology to completely make the planet green and reverse climate change. The catch being that the technology for that (carbon capture, solar, wind ect.) at current cost and economy of making it, would be around 350,000,000,000,000 USD (I am no professional in the matter, this is a seriously rough estimate based on the few non-biased articles I have read on the subject), which is more money than exists on the entire planet. This number is based on our current pollution rate.

No carbon tax will ever pay for that however. The framework is there for success, these small increments every year lower the cost of that by trillions of dollars and gives companies and researchers the money necessary to create the infrastructure and technology required to make this plausible.

If everyone on earth switched to electric cars, it would be lowered by around 1/3rd. If green renewable energy completely removed fossil fuels, it would cut a third from that price. If one of these startups successfully made fusion technology, it would cut the cost upwards of 70%. After a while we aren't talking about an unfathomable amount of money, suddenly we are down to 10,000,000,000,000 which while staggering, would be easily accomplished with a global effort.

First, catastrophic weather related events may so damage civilization, as we know it, that what is left will only be capable of a much smaller effect on the biosphere.

Second, there's no evidence of any breakthrough technology that could reduce the CO2 and other GHGs in the atmosphere sufficiently to reverse global heating. At best what appears possible is a slowing down of the rate of heating.

Third, there's no evidence to suggest humankind is capable of implementing any measures that would reverse global heating.

It’s often politically appealing to solve issues an electorate is buzzing about by “investing” money to tackle the issue. Across government, money is thrown at issues in completely irrational attempts to disrupt reality. Yet these technological solutions are too often designed around simplified use cases, not complex abuse cases. Without a clear grounding in reality, these solutions cause harm to the same people they were naively intended to protect. 

The reality is that almost any technical advance has benefits and harms. Often the benefits and harms are unevenly distributed – one group may reap most or all of the benefits while others receive all or most of the harm.

We cannot hedge our bets on creating a non existent technology to fix the problems caused by modern day technology: heat and waste.

De-growth is the only real way to offset the effects of climate change."
jtubbtg,plantaloca,1,"It’s a matter of us electing leaders that are already aligned with human well being. 

New technologies will help but they cannot solve it all at once. It’s combination of new regulations, consumer behavior and lifestyle. We all are a little too polarized to cooperate and work together."
jtuckrg,greenfrogfox,0,"So in other words, global warming was not caused by small man made things like Diesel engines, coal supplied power plants, burning of fossil fuels."
jtud3gq,some-random-number,1,I think we need to just have more ways to compensate all that causes ho2 pollution. Like how we can travel with being eco friendly. Not just reducing all travelling. That is the kind of thecnology that will change our future. Also we cant just collect the pollution from the air. That doesnt help us anywhere.
jtuhtij,Jumpy-Author-4985,1,"There will be no solving climate change,  we are way past that point"
jtuj3es,TheRadBaron,1,"Science isn't magic. We can't predict exactly what future innovations will happen, but we are actually pretty good at understanding certain limits. We can't travel through time, we can't go faster than the speed of light, we can't build wings that let people fly around using their own muscle power, we can't build perpetual motion engines.

It takes lots of energy (and infrastructure and political will) to pull carbon out of the atmosphere and bury it underground. It will *always* take more energy to emit and re-capture carbon, than to not emit it in the first place. There are basic thermodynamic laws at play here, we will never invent a cheat code that lets us fix things without serious effort. The longer we wait, the more effort is required, and the smaller the payoff. 

>We are the human race and we’re nothing if not flexible and adaptable when push comes to shove.

Countless human civilizations have collapsed due to extremely small changes in local climates. It's easy to forget, because it was always a local thing, and human beings elsewhere were thriving, but humans constantly come up against this kind of issue and fail. Entire societies gone, an effective extinction from their own perspective.

Global climate devastation is a new issue, there are no humans elsewhere to thrive if we die. Global political instability in the presence of nuclear weapons is also untested."
jtujupe,Sedu,1,"There is no one thing that will save us *if anything does*. Keep in mind that our salvation is not some kind of foregone conclusion. Civilization might simply fall. There is nothing which says that is impossible.

Small, piecemeal changes buy us time, which we desperately need. If our world collapses before we come up with that technological savior that you're hoping for? We're screwed."
jtujy71,Awkward_Document_515,1,"I said this on another thread, but I think the solution (not a politically popular option) is to invest in clean energy for developing countries. Developing countries don’t have the means or financial resources to change there energy systems. This plan is outlined within the Paris climate accord where richer countries invest in developing countries energy mix, but it’s underfunded. I think if you can get a developing countries on a similar energy mix to a wealthier nation this would help mitigate the effects of climate change and we already have the technology to do it. Unfortunately this would require world wide cooperation and this hasn’t happened to date"
jtul8bx,PIeseThink,1,This is 100% facts. Reddit scientists have no clue when they’re talking about when it comes to climate change and global warming. Only thing that can save us at this point is some type of technological break through in which that is space travel or atmosphere manipulation.
jtunalv,DanfromCalgary,1,Sounds like this doesn't recycle
jtuqwvh,zmamo2,1,"Just going to add tha, while new technological breakthroughs would help tremendously, we have already come across the technical breakthroughs required for the transition away from fossil fuels.  

Solar panels are now the cheapest form of energy humans have ever created. That combined with incredible improvements in battery technology, heat pumps, and electrolyzers means that the transition is more an issue of implementation rather than one of discovery."
jturqqn,YamaShio,0,"Based on what? Your hopes and fears? Its not HOW we'll solve climate change, it's IF.  
No, we might not solve it with small incremental changes. But that means it's likely we'll fail and all DIE, not invent magic."
jtv3ta0,Majestic_Return3052,1,"Most people won't take the time,.effort, or money to change their everyday lives. They don't care. People don't care about a problem until it's half an inch from their face"
jtv4xmx,Competitive-Initial7,1,Your belief is premised on the assumption that global warming will be solved. Humans have proved time and again they value sensationalism and politics over science. We are willingly laying the groundwork for an extinction era...
jtv682t,lkattan3,1,"Ecological economists have repeatedly said Incremental won’t save us and neither can we bet on innovation saving us. Both of these ideas are in the vein that capitalism must remain to have a livable planet, that continual GDP growth is a necessity to well-being (although pursuing growth makes the task of a sufficiently rapid renewable transition impossible). GDP is irrelevant to human well-being and nearly half of all the resources we use, and half of all the emissions we emit, is done in order to make rich people richer. Economic growth is the primary driver of the problem and that can be addressed but it won’t be incremental nor will it be innovative. We need degrowth.

“[The power of universal public services is that we can improve people’s access to goods necessary for decent living, with provisioning systems that require less aggregate energy and material use and which allow us to accelerate decarbonization.  These outcomes can be further enhanced by ensuring strong democratic governance of public systems. Together with the job guarantee, economic insecurity is permanently abolished — accomplishing a goal that growth alone has never been able to achieve — and human well-being is de-linked from the requirement of ever-increasing aggregate production.  This would change the political landscape, freeing us to pursue necessary climate action without any risk to employment and livelihoods, while improving social outcomes, reducing inequality and facilitating a shift toward a more just and ecological economy](https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog).”

Public control over provisioning systems makes it easier to achieve rapid decarbonization. The idea is to allocate resources and energy more rationally, and more democratically, to enable everyone to live flourishing lives in balance with the ecosystems we depend on."
jtvi49c,jordanapolis,1,I guess our carbon emissions will go down drastically once it's too hot for humans to do all the work required to consume fossil fuels
jtvqzrf,PdxPhoenixActual,1,And not even that. It was too late a couple of decades ago.
jtw52vm,Malcontent2-55,1,"Yea, if only we had clean nuclear power on a large scale."
jtwid9o,Flowers1966,1,"First of all I think that global warming is both true and a myth. Climate has always changed. Some deserts during biblical times were fertile farmlands. 

Too many of the current solutions to ‘global warming’ are not efficient or cost effective. The solutions being proposed have environmental problems. We do not have enough centers to reprogram solar panels so that many outdated solar panels go to trash. Electric cars are not cost effective or convenient. Windmills kill wildlife. 

Should we try to find better energy? Of course. But should we advance false solutions? Of course not."
jtx071s,p1-KateHowe,1,"While small changes like driving hybrids or reducing meat consumption may not solve global warming on their own, they're still important steps. We can't overlook their collective impact. However, I'm all in for that big technological breakthrough you mentioned! Whether it's glitter in the sky or fusion power cleaning the air, we need some innovation. As the human race, we've shown resilience before, and I believe we can find a way to tackle climate change with creativity and ambition."
jtx6c5h,Deleted,1,"It's 2024. We should have unlocked the Arcology by now, and we'll have microwave power in a few years. That should help."
jtxd32n,Radiant_Practice5176,1,Artificialization is our main trouble. We have artificialized all our major environments and yet to resolve it.
jtxggah,Barnfred_Knarst,1,"I agreed up to the word ‘technological’. The breakthrough we need is systemic. We need to change the way we design our society: as long as we do not change the current power structures, the aim for GDP growth and our consumer mindset, I do not believe it is possible to achieve meaningful change. Technological breakthroughs usually enforce these old systems and therefore I do not see that working in the long run."
jtxgm4t,ovastvnas,1,cool
jtz6zk0,ghotier,1,"If I told you that you were half right, would that potentially change your view? Because you're right, it won't be solved by incremental change, because it won't be solved."
ju0fe0t,snide_soul,1,"I don't think you would want to do any ""blocking out the sun"". The earth isn't getting warmer, it's actually getting colder. Colder winters are coming along. Countries that have never gotten snow are getting snow. We have a higher chance of entering an Ice Age then this ""global warming"" coming true. Granted, yes, we are poisoning the air with rich people flying their private jets back and forth across the world, and that needs to be stopped. You know what also needs to be stopped to prevent that though? **People need to stop burning down forests and saying ""Oh, global warming caused these fires!"".**"
