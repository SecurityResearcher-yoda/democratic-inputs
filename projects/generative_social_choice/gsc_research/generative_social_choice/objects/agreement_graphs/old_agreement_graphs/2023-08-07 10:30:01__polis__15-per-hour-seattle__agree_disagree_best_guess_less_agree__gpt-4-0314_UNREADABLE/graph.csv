comments,Reactionary liberal trash. Doesn't solve the problem. It's a systemic problem and this solution is like a band aid on a broken leg.,This is something that will impact SMB who cannot afford paying 15$/hour wage,"It's possible benefits may be cut in exchange for higher wages, along with other benefits. Worth it?",It's so high that it will definitely cost some needy people their jobs.,Minimum wage will not just lead to robots. Minimum wage will lead to unionized robots. And that's a good thing.,This will cause small businesses to go out of business.,Good move. Will boost econy here,"One step towards a world where a basic minimum income will be the way developed nations must function as the need for human workers collapses vs populace that ""needs a job.""",Guaranteed minimum income! Remove all the specific programs!,Something needs to be done to address income inequality and this is a good if imperfect start
