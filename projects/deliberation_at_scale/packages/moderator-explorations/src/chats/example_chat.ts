    // {"name": "John", "message": "Using AI could be seen as an unfair advantage."},
    // {"name": "Mark", "message": "Allowing AI might lead to students relying too heavily on technology and not actually learning the material."},
    // {"name": "Sarah", "message": "Exams are a way to evaluate our understanding of the subject matter. If we use AI for everything, how can we be sure that we've truly learned the material?"},
    // {"name": "John", "message": "But isn't it also true that in the real world, we often use AI tools to assist us in making decisions and solving problems?"},
    // {"name": "Mark", "message": "Not all students have access to the same level of AI technology."},
    // {"name": "Sarah", "message": "I agree with Mark on this one. Some students might have access to more advanced AI tools, giving them an unfair advantage over others. That could lead to academic inequality."},
    // {"name": "John", "message": "You're right, Sarah. That's a concern. But what if schools provided access to standardized AI tools for all students during exams? That way, everyone would have an equal opportunity."},
    // {"name": "Mark", "message": "That's an interesting idea, John, but it would require a significant investment from schools, and not all institutions may be able to afford it. Plus, there's still the question of whether it's the right approach."}
