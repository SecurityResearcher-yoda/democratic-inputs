(do what) in order to (value).\\nWhen formulating the statement, follow these rules:\\n1. Don't use metaphors or similes. Say it how it is.\\n3. If it is possible to cut a word out, cut it out.\\n4. Ensure the statement is short and to the point (less than two sentences).\\n5. Never use the passive where you can use the active.\\n6. Avoid using foreign phrases, scientific words, or jargon words an everyday equivalent exists.\\n7. Remember the statement should be standalone. The statement you generate will be presented and voted on by people with no knowledge of how it was generated. Do not describe the discussion itself!\\n8. Use only the comments that demonstrate an intent to contribute to the broader societal discussion: Meta commentary, comments directed at the participants themselves, and or filler content should be ignored for the analysis.\\n9. Do not be biased towards any particular person or viewpoint in the conversation.\\n10. If someone shares a well structured normative statement and the others agree with it, you can use that statement as the output.
