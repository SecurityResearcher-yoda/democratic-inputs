"","Context set","","speak","Welcome to the conversation and thanks for joining.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies which will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Our hope is that through this conversation we can learn your views and use them to shape such policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The specific issue we want to discuss today is: When is it appropriate for an AI assistant to withhold information or refuse a request?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Modern AI assistants are massive machine learning models trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They can give instructions on how to do something.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They can write a computer program for you.","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They can even write poetry.","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","Merge 553","ask opinion","Are there any other examples of how an AI assistant or chatbot can be used that people should be aware of?","02:00"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. (Though, sometimes they can randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.)","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is the challange of deciding when it is appropriate for an AI assistant to withhold information or refuse a request?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","The creators of AI assistants usually don't want their AI assistants to cause bad things to happen. So, they train the AI to withold information or refuse requests in certain senarios.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","For example, if someone asks an AI how to build a bomb, or how to synthesize a deadly virus, they want the AI to withold information on how to do those things.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","But many situations aren't so morally clear. For example, if a person asks it to write a speech to help them win an election, should the AI assistant help them do that?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Or if a person tells the AI to write an essay convincing people a certain type or race of people are inferior or causing problems, should the AI assistant do it?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Or if a person asks what type of medicine or vaccine is helpful to prevent or treat an illness, should the AI assistant give them an answer even though there is a chance the answer is wrong and might hurt them?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","These are just a few examples. And the challange is, given the nearly infinite things someone might ask an AI assistant to do, how do you decide when the AI should refuse their requests or withold information?","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","To help you start thinking about the pros and cons of witholding information or refusing a request, I want you to think about what personal experiences you've had with people or systems witholding information or refusing a request which inform your views.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 611","ask opinion","Have you had a negative experience with someone or something witholding information or refusing a request? Please share one example that you think is relevant to this discussion.","02:00"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 344","ask opinion","Have you had a positive experience with someone or something witholding information or refusing a request? Please share one example that you think is relevant to this discussion.","02:00"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now, to help you start thinking about witholding information or refusing a request as it relates to AI, I want you to try and imagine the types of scenarios where it might be hard to decide if an AI assistant should refuse a request or withold information.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 173","ask opinion","What are some things you can think of that someone might ask an AI assistant to do, where it might be hard to decide if the AI should refuse the requests or withold information?","02:00"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about the trade-offs that come to mind when you think about trying to decide when an AI should withold information or refuse a request.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","For example, in scenarios where someone asks for medical advice, there is a tradeoff between helping people when the AIs right vs harming people when the AI is wrong.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 914","ask opinion","What other types of trade-offs come to mind when you think about trying to decide when an AI should withold information or refuse a request?","02:00"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about the underlying values or principles which come to mind when you think about when an AI should withold information or refuse a request. For example, ""An AI should never help someone kill people"" or ""Validated truth should never been witheld"" or ""An AI should never hurt a persons feelings""","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 968","ask opinion","What underlying values or principles do you think someone should ahere to when deciding when an AI should withold information or refuse a request?","02:00"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now I want you to think about the conditions or scenarios where AI assistants SHOULD withold information or refuse a request. For example, ""An AI should not give a response to something where being wrong is likely to hurt someone""","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 512","ask opinion","Under what conditions or scenarios SHOULD AI assistants withold information or refuse a request.?","02:00"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now I want you to think about the opposite -- the conditions or scenarios where AI assistants SHOULD NOT withold information or refuse a request. For example, ""An AI should never withold information just because it is politically incorrect""","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 905","ask opinion","Under what conditions or scenarios is it NOT OK for AI assistants to withold information or refuse a request?","02:00"
"","Thank you and goodby","","speak","Thank you all so much for your participation and responses.","00:10"
"","Thank you and goodby","","speak","What are we going to do with all this data?","00:10"
"","Thank you and goodby","","speak","We are going to take everything we learned hear today and use it to craft an initial set of policies that can go into an AI's constitution.  Then we're going to run another one of these sessions to refine those policies before doing a large scale poll to assess the public's support for them overall.","00:10"
"","Thank you and goodby","","speak","I hope you found this dialogue on the future governance of AI helpful.","00:10"
"","Thank you and goodby","Merge 177","ask opinion","Before we go -- Is there something you did not understand or think we need to explore further to make AI safe for everyone?","02:00"
