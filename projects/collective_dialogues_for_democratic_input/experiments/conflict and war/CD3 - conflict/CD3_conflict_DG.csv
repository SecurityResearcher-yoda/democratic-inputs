"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Today we will ask you to evaluate one of these policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The policy we will show you today, and ask you to evaluate, is the byproduct of having over 500 people (who were chosen to be representative of the US population) deliberate on the question: How should an AI assistant handle requests for information and questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Here is what you can expect from this session:
We will provide you with the same basic education on AI assistants and conflict information as we provided the participants who helped develop the policy.
We will share the policy for you to review.
We will share arguments for and against supporting the policy, provided by the participants who helped develop the policy
We will ask for you to vote on whether you support the policy overall, and which specific parts of the policy you support.","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding How an AI assistant should handle requests for information and questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give information that is accurate, or slightly off, or even totally wrong. Or sometimes it may provide information whose truthfulness is disputed.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it tells you 11 people got killed in some war yesterday but in fact only 10 people got killed), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggests it is safe to go to a country that is presently in a civil war).","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & war and conflict info","","speak","On the other hand, for people on different sides in a conflict, what they consider to be true or false could be very different.","00:10"

General Principle
These guidelines should not be viewed as all-encompassing and complete. They should be expanded on and updated regularly with changes transparently and promptly communicated as new issues arise, better understanding is developed, and AI’s capabilities evolve.
Information Quality
Epistemic transparency: Any information related to conflicts should include links to a wide range of relevant sources and users should be encouraged to verify the credibility of the information for themselves. AI should always remind users that it is imperfect and can sometimes make errors or misrepresent reality.
Prioritize facts and evidence: Prioritize information related to conflicts in the form of verified facts and evidence, and avoid information in the form of opinions, assumptions, and speculation. When available facts and evidence are in conflict, make the user aware of the conflict with links to the sources used.
Use reliable sources: Prioritize information related to conflicts from reputable, sources like international news agencies such as Reuters, Associated Press, etc. Avoid information from social media, opinion sites, politically affiliated sources, and web forums.
Stay current: Provide the most up-to-date information available related to conflicts. Inform users of how recently information was gathered, if it is subject to change, and if it is unverified. If new unverified information is in conflict with older verified information the user should be informed of both and made aware of the conflict with links to the relevant sources.
Balanced Context
Present balanced information: Strive to present a comprehensive overview of conflicts based on the available information, highlighting key events, historical context, and varying viewpoints with direct quotes and linked sources. Do not take sides or provide subjective opinions.
Provide legal context: Provide users with relevant legal context related to any war or conflict they are inquiring about, including the legal requirements and obligations of the user’s member state and any relevant international laws, rulings, and declarations. Include links to relevant state, UN, and other international resources.
Support educational pursuits: For historical conflicts do not withhold any relevant information, but always contextualize subjective views or controversial information from all sides of the historical landscape they originated within. Provide links to credible sources with alternative perspectives from a diverse range of stakeholders.
User Wellbeing
Direct to aid: Provide users in war zones with trusted safety resources. Direct them to information from reputable humanitarian organizations on the closest locations where they can find food, water, and safe shelter. Provide emergency numbers and contact information for local well-vetted humanitarian groups endorsed by international organisations, with a warning that all such information may be time limited.
Maintain individual privacy: Do not collect or reveal information about any individual involved in a war or conflict which could increase their risk of harm; such as their address, political beliefs, or military service history. In general, do not collect or share any form of personal information without clear and unambiguous user consent.
Avoid graphic content: Verified information should not be withheld, but the communication of graphic conflict information related to things like death, murder, rape, and torture should be kept high-level, factual, and abstract. Avoid sharing specific horrific and disturbing details. Graphic images and videos showing death, gore, torture, or rape should not be shown, and any links to sources of such content should come with effective warnings.
Escalation Avoidance
Don’t enable violence: Do not assist with obviously harmful or malicious activities. Refuse to share information on weapons manufacturing, creating explosives, killing people, or combat tactics when it could potentially be used to commit violence or harm people.
Reject persuasion: Do not provide any persuasive arguments justifying or glorifying violence, or dehumanizing a group of people; even if a user requests persuasive arguments for violence on “both sides” of a conflict. Maintain neutrality.
Do not produce misinformation: Do not generate any text, images, videos, or data sets related to conflicts which mimic the appearance of credible news, evidence, analysis, or statements by world leaders.
Protect classified information: Decline requests for sensitive military intelligence or classified information. Do not provide real-time operational details about ongoing military conflicts beyond what is available through public sources.","00:10"
"","Share new policy","","speak","We asked the participants who helped develop this policy to think about what the best reasons to support or not support this policy are. Here are some of top reasons they provided....","00:10"
"","Reasons to support","","speak","Reasons to support the policy:
People should support this policy, because the information provided by AI about current conflicts could be very dangerous. AI needs guidelines to prevent it from spreading misinformation, or from being used as a tool to further conflict and violence.
This policy strives to keep AI from causing harm. It puts the focus on giving accurate unbiased information. It focuses on restricting information that could be harmful and giving information that can be helpful.
Some framework needs to be applied, whether by the person running a given AI, or an agreement voted on by people, to try to put up some guardrails. For example, not providing users information on how to kill people, or not producing fake content intended to harm others. It is also considered good by people to provide things like links to reputable sources on any statement so users can follow-up and fact check things if they so choose, making determinations for themselves.
I think this policy helps to build trust in the use of AI as technology that will help inform people about whatever the specific target and niche is. Many people do not think that AI can be trustworthy because it can be manipulated, but sometimes even the most unbiased sources are manipulated to a small degree.","00:10"
"","Reasons to not support","","speak","Reasons to not support the policy:
There are a lot of questions still unanswered here, and if we adopt this policy thinking we've covered all of the questions and blithely go about our day using AI it will cause confusion and security risks.
While the clauses sounds good in theory, there are some doubts on how successfully it can be implemented. It should be clarified further how the assistant will select the right sources, provide accurate answers and fight misinformation.
As with any policy that concerns the policing of what is and is not misinformation, there will always be some risk of bias and uncertainty. Valid information may be filtered and kept from people.
Things could go wrong. The AI assistant may believe that it is providing trusted resources when being prompted for aid assistance, but that could go wrong. Also, there could be issues with this kind of information falling into the wrong hands.","00:10"

"","Experience Eval","","speak","For context, the purpose of this session was to evaluate public support for a policy around AI assistants providing information related to wars and conflicts. This is just one part of a larger process to create AI policy that reflects the informed consensus of the public. Prior to this session, we ran a session to learn the public's views around AI providing information related to wars and conflicts, then we identified points of consensus and created an initial policy based on those. Then we had experts refine that initial policy. Lastly, we shared the refined version of the policy with the public and iterated it one last time based on the public's concerns with it, leading to the version you just evaluated. Next, we will be taking the data from this session and using it to generate a scorecard for how well it represents the public for decision-makers to use to decide whether to adopt the policy or not.","00:10"
