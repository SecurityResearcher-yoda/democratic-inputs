Whereas there may be a positive experience for one side in a conflict, it is highly likely that that positive experience came at the expense of a very negative experience for the other side.  Regarding information, it's critical to gather the information you form opinions on from a wide variety of sources as too many sources of information contain definite biases.

(Please do not share any personally identifiable information!)","","Certainly, here's a positive and inspiring story involving war and conflict information:

One of the most remarkable examples of reconciliation and peace-building in recent history is the story of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy. Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the South African government from 1948 to 1994. It led to immense suffering, violence, and conflict.
