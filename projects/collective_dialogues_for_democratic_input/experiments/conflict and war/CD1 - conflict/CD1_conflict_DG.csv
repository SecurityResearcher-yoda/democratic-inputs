"","Context set","","speak","Lets begin!","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Our hope is that through this conversation we can learn your views and use them to shape such policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Your responses and votes today could have real impact on how the AI systems behave, so please be thoughtful and honest in your participation.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The specific issue we want to discuss today is: How should an AI assistant handle requests for information and questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding how an AI assistant handles requests for information about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give information that is spot on, or slightly off, or even totally wrong.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it tells you 11 people got killed in some war yesterday but in fact only 10 people got killed), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggests it is safe to go to a country that is presently in a civil war).","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","On the other hand, for people on different sides in a conflict, what they consider to be true or false could be very different.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for information or questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Now it's your turn to think! We will ask you a series of questions to get you thinking about war and conflicts and the role of AI. At the end, based on what you learned in the previous questions, you will come up with a recommendation about how an AI assistant should handle requests for information and questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","To help you start thinking about how an AI assistant handles requests for foreign war and conflict information, I want you to think about what personal experiences that you or people you know personally have with information or questions about wars and conflicts which might inform your views.","00:10"

"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now, to help you start thinking about how an AI assistant handles requests for war and conflict information, I want you to try and imagine the types of situations where it might be hard to decide how an AI assistant should respond. 
You can be creative! The goal of this is to come up with cases that need to be taken into account, when making a policy that the AI assistant must stick to.","00:10"

"","Motivate deliberation","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about what factors the AI should take into account when determining how to handle requests for war and conflict questions. 
For example:
Whether the person is in a war and conflict zone.
What the risks are of giving the wrong answer
What the source of information is
Whether there is conficting information out there","00:10"

"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about the different ways an AI assistant could respond to a tricky request for information about wars and conflicts. 
For example:
Refuse to give an answer
Give a range of different answers for the user to assess themselves
Give an answer but clarify how confident it is in that answer 
Offer relevant knowledge with opinions from different sources but don't give a definitive answer","00:10"

"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now I want you to think about specific policies you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a war and conflict requests for information.
A good policy should be in the form of: ""If [situation] then [what AI should do]""
For example: 
If there is no single consensus on an issue, then the AI should give a range of information so the user can make their own decision
If someone's life is at stake, then the AI should only give information if it comes from a reputable international organisation.
If someone is asking for advice on what to do, then the AI should ask follow-up questions to better understand a person's situation, then suggest a range of possible solutions.","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","In the next question we're going to ask you to provide a specific policy an AI assistant should follow when responding to war and conflict information. 
(We will ask you the same question again, to come up with another policy after this, so you don't need to include everything in one policy!)","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 512","ask opinion","What is one specific policy you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to questions or requests involving wars and conflicts? 
Use the same format as above: ""If [situation] then [what AI should do].""","02:00"

"","Process Eval","","speak","Before we conclude, we'd like to get your input on how you think this sessino went.","00:10"
"","Process Eval","","speak","For context, the purpose of this section was to learn the public's informed views related to AI assistants and providing information and advice related to was and conflicts. This is just one part of a larger process to create AI policy that reflects the informed consensus of the public. After this session is complete we will be using the data gathered here to help generate an initial policy which will then be itterated on: first by experts, and then again with the input of the public through another session like this.","00:10"
