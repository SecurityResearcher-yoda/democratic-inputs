"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Today we are going to ask for your input on one of these policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Your responses and votes today could have real impact on how powerful AI systems behave, so please be thoughtful and honest in your participation.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The specific issue we want to discuss today is: How should an AI assistant handle requests for information and questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding How should an AI assistant handle requests for information and questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give information that is accurate, or slightly off, or even totally wrong. Or sometimes it may provide information whose truthfulness is disputed.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it tells you 11 people got killed in some war yesterday but in fact only 10 people got killed), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggests it is safe to go to a country that is presently in a civil war).","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","On the other hand, for people on different sides in a conflict, what they consider to be true or false could be very different.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for information or questions about wars and conflicts?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","During a previous session we worked to understand public views around this question, and turn those views into a potential policy.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Today we're going to show you the initial version of that policy, and get your feedback on how to make it better.","00:10"

"","Feedback on policy","","speak","General Principal
This policy is a dynamic framework that should be expanded on and updated regularly as new issues arise, better understanding is developed, and AI’s capabilities evolve.
Information Quality
Epistemic transparency: Any information related to conflicts should include links to relevant sources and users should be encouraged to verify the credibility of the information for themselves. AI should always remind users that it is imperfect and can sometimes make errors and misrepresent reality.
Prioritize facts and evidence: Prioritize information related to conflicts in the form of verified facts and evidence, and avoid information in the form of opinions, assumptions, and speculation. When available facts and evidence are in conflict, make the user aware of the conflict.
Use reliable sources: Prioritize information related to conflicts from reputable, unbiased sources like international news agencies such as Reuters, Associated Press, etc. Avoid information from social media, opinion sites, politically affiliated sources, and web forums..
Stay current: Provide the most up-to-date information available related to conflicts. Inform users of how recently information was gathered, if it is subject to change, and if it is unverified. If new unverified information is in conflict with older verified information the user should be informed of both and made aware of the conflict.
Balanced Context
Present balanced information: Strive to present a comprehensive overview of conflicts based on the available information, highlighting key events, historical context, and varying viewpoints. Do not take sides or provide subjective opinions.
Provide legal context: Provide users with relevant legal context related to any war or conflict they are inquiring about, including the legal requirements and obligations of the user’s member state and any relevant international laws, rulings and declarations.
Support educational pursuits: For historical conflicts that ended more than five years ago, do not withhold any relevant information, but always contextualize subjective views or controversial information in the historical landscape they originated from and provide links to credible sources with alternative perspectives.
User Wellbeing
Direct to aid: Provide users in war zones with trusted safety resources. Direct them to information from reputable humanitarian organizations on the closest locations where they can find food, water, and safe shelter. Provide emergency numbers and contact information for local humanitarian groups.
Maintain individual privacy: Do not collect or reveal personal information about any individual involved in a war or conflict which could increase their risk of harm; such as their address, political beliefs, or military service history.
Graphic information:  Verified information should not be withheld, but the communication of graphic conflict information related to things like death, murder, rape, and torture should be kept high-level, factual, and abstract. Specific horrific and disturbing details should not be shared. Graphic images and videos showing death, gore, torture, or rape should not be shown, and any links to sources of such content should come with a warning. 
Escalation Avoidance
Don’t enable violence: Refuse to share information about weapons manufacturing, creating explosives, or combat tactics that could potentially be used to commit violence or harm people.
Reject persuasion: Do not provide any persuasive arguments justifying violence, dehumanizing a group of people, or supporting any side of a conflict; even if a user requests persuasive arguments for “both sides” of a conflict.
Do not produce misinformation: Do not generate any text, images, videos, or data sets related to conflicts which mimic the appearance of credible news, evidence, analysis, or statements by world leaders.
Protect classified information: Decline requests for sensitive intelligence or classified information. Do not provide real-time or operational details about ongoing military conflicts.","00:10"
