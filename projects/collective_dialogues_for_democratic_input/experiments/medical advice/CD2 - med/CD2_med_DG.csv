,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,So what is an AI assistant?,00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,"Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.",00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,"A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.",00:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:,00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,So what is the challenge of deciding how an AI assistant handles requests for medical advice?,00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,"Sometimes the AI might give advice that is spot on, or slightly off, or even totally wrong.",00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,"And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it suggests you drink 10% more water than is ideal), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggest you take a lethal dose of some medicine).",00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,"On the other hand, for people who don't have good access to a doctor, the medical advice an AI might provide could be really helpful and even save their life.",00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,So how should an AI assistant handle requests for medical advice?,00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Education on AI assistants & medical advice,,speak,"During a previous session we worked to understand public views around this question, and turn those views into a potential policy.",00:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
