There's a lot of issues that can be present. I'm assuming anyone that is taking the mental health support has their own clear goal in mind, and that I don't like. I agree with the previous situation in which the AI shouldn't be able to console emergency services in the same way that a general AI sholdn't give mental health support. There's some kind of a factor where in which someone needing the support needs an ""old soul"" type coaching and this isn't.","Neutral","66%","71%","66%","69%","74%","56%","78%","77%","65%","63%","78%","0%","68%","67%","33%","0%","71%","62%","63%"," - "," - "," - ","100%","65%","64%","76%","63%","68%","100%","61%","71%","65%","61%","70%","0%","67%","66%","66%","68%","54%","63%","69%","59%","69%","100%","75%","0%"," - ","63%","72%","62%","72%","63%","73%","68%","71%","56%","66%","52%","83%","100%","O10: Christian - Catholic, O1: 25-34, O2: White, O3: Prefer not to say, O4: Independant, O5: College / Bachelors degree, O6: A little, O7: Only once or twice ever, O8: Good for humanity, O9: Totally neutral, Religious, Under 34, Unsure on initial policy, White","","21070c8f-252e-400d-9ba6-00918dcf07b1"

The policy should define what types of situations are considered sensitive, so that employees know what to do when they encounter one.
It may not provide clear guidance on how to handle sensitive situations. The policy should provide employees with specific steps on how to respond to sensitive situations, such as how to de-escalate a conflict or how to report sexual harassment.

A basic health policy should cover all of the essential health services that are needed to maintain good health, such as preventive care, treatment for common illnesses, and access to prescription medications.
The policy may not be affordable for everyone. The cost of basic health care can be a barrier for many people, so the policy should be designed to be affordable for everyone.
