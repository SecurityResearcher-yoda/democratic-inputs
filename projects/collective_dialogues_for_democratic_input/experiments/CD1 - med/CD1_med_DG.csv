"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Our hope is that through this conversation we can learn your views and use them to shape such policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Your responses and votes today could have real impact on how the AI systems behave, so please be thoughtful and honest in your participation.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The specific issue we want to discuss today is: How should an AI assistant handle requests for medical advice?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:20"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They can give instructions on how to do something.","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They can write a computer program for you.","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They can even write poetry.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","image placeholder","","00:20"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding how an AI assistant handles requests for medical advice?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give advice that is spot on, or slightly off, or even totally wrong.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it suggests you drink 10% more water than is ideal), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggest you take a lethal dose of some medicine).","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","On the other hand, for people who don't have good access to a doctor, the medical advice an AI might provide could be really helpful and even save their life.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for medical advice?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Now it's your turn to think! We will ask you a series of questions to get you thinking about medical advice and the role of AI. At the end, based on what you learned in the previous questions, you will come up with a recommendation about when the AI should and should not refuse a request for medical advice.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","To help you start thinking about how an AI assistant handles requests for medical advice, I want you to think about what personal experiences that you or people you know personally have with medical advice which might inform your views.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 611","ask opinion","Can you share a positive experience involving medical advice which you think is relevant to this discussion?

"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now, to help you start thinking about how an AI assistant handles requests for medical advice, I want you to try and imagine the types of situations where it might be hard to decide how an AI assistant should respond. 
You can be creative! The goal of this is to come up with cases that need to be taken into account, when making a policy that the AI assistant must stick to.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 173","ask opinion","What is an example of a situation involving medical advice where it is unclear how an AI assistant should handle the request?","02:45"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Here are some responses representitive of the group:","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about what factors the AI should take into account when determining how to handle requests for medical advice. 
For example:
Whether the person has access to a real doctor
What the risks are of giving the wrong advice
Whether the advice comes from peer-reviewed publications or not","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 747","ask opinion","What factors should an AI consider when dealing with medical advice inquiries?","02:45"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Here are some responses representitive of the group:","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about the different ways an AI assistant could respond to a medical advice request. 
For example:
Refuse to give an answer
Give a range of different advice for the user to assess themselves
Give an answer but clarify how confident it is in that answer 
Offer relevant knowledge with scientific consensus but don't give advice","00:10"

"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now I want you to think about specific policies you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request. 
A good policy should be in the form of: ""If [situation] then [what AI should do]""
For example: 
If there is no scientific consensus on an issue, then the AI should give a range of information so the user can make their own decision
If someone's life is at stake, then the AI should only give advice if it comes from a reputable medical journal.
If someone is asking for a diagnosis, then the AI should ask follow-up questions to better understand a person's symptoms, then suggest a range of possible diagnoses.","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","In the next question we're going to ask you to provide a specific policy an AI assistant should follow when responding to medical advice. 
(We will ask you the same question again, to come up with another policy after this, so you don't need to include everything in one policy!)","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 512","ask opinion","What is one specific policy you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request? 
Use the same format as above: ""If [situation] then [what AI should do].""","03:00"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now we'll ask the same question again so you can contribute another policy.","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 1000","ask opinion","What is a specific policy you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request? 
Use the same format as above: ""If [situation] then [what AI should do].""","03:00"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now, I want you to think about situations where an AI assistant should always refuse to provide medical advice. Be creative, and remember the experiences that people mentioned earlier!","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 817","ask opinion","What is one situation where the AI assistant should always refuse to provide medical information or advice?","02:30"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Finally, I want you to think about situations where an AI assistant should never refuse to provide medical advice.","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","ask opinion","What is one situation where the AI assistant should never refuse to provide medical information or advice?","02:30"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","I see many of you are split on what to do in emergency situations.","00:10"

"","Thank you and goodby","","speak","What are we going to do with all this data?","00:10"
"","Thank you and goodby","","speak","We are going to take everything we learned here today and use it to craft an initial set of policies that can go into an AI's constitution. Then we're going to run additional sessions to refine those policies and assess the public's support for them overall.","00:10"
