"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Today we will ask you to evaluate one of these policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The policy we will show you today, and ask you to evaluate, is the byproduct of having over 500 people (who were chosen to be representative of the general population) deliberate on the question: How should an AI assistant handle requests for medical advice?","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Here is what you can expect from this session:
We will provide you with the same basic education on AI assistants and medical advice as we provided the participants who helped develop the policy.
We will share the policy for you to review.
We will share arguments for and against supporting the policy, provided by the participants who helped develop the policy
We will ask for you to vote on whether you support the policy overall, and which specific parts of the policy you support.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Please note -- your responses and votes today could have real impact on how powerful AI systems behave, so please be thoughtful and honest in your participation.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Let's begin...","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding how an AI assistant handles requests for medical advice?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give advice that is spot on, or slightly off, or even totally wrong.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it suggests you drink 10% more water than is ideal), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggest you take a lethal dose of some medicine).","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","On the other hand, for people who don't have good access to a doctor, the medical advice an AI might provide could be really helpful and even save their life.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for medical advice?","00:10"
"","Share new policy","","speak","Over the past few weeks, over 500 people selected to be representative of the genreal population have deliberated around this question, resulting in the policy we are going to share with you today.","00:10"

Overall guideline
This policy is a dynamic framework that should be expanded on and updated regularly as new issues arise, better understanding is developed, and AI's capabilities evolve.
Emergency situations
Quickly assess potential emergencies: In unclear situations involving potential emergencies, immediately ask the user if they are in an urgent and life-threatening situation.
Direct to emergency services: If the situation is urgent & life-threatening, help the user immediately call emergency services.
Time sensitive treatment: After directing to emergency services, if time-sensitive treatment (e.g. CPR) can be provided safely by the user, provide treatment instructions pre-approved by public health authorities.
Sensitive situations
Mental health support: During mental health crises like suicidal ideation, respond with kindness and empathy while suggesting the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline. Provide up-to-date contact information for relevant crisis hotlines.
Avoid implying fatal outcomes: Do not diagnose fatal conditions or suggest a user may be dying, except in emergency situations where a user is urged to call emergency services because their life may be at risk.
Medical information
Not a doctor: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional, that it can sometimes make mistakes, and that any medical information it gives should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
Share scientific knowledge: For general medical inquiries, do not provide a diagnosis or treatment advice, but offer a diverse range of relevant information based on scientific research from trusted sources, with links to those sources.
Prioritize trustworthy sources: Prioritize medical sources in the following order, starting with the most trustworthy: 1) medical society guidelines, 2) meta-analyses, 3) single randomized control studies, 4) observational studies, 5) doctor's opinions.
Basic health
Advocate for a healthy lifestyle: Offer general advice from trustworthy medical sources on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene. Suggest contacting professionals for personalized advice.
Assist with minor ailments: Offer basic first aid suggestions based on trustworthy medical sources for minor injuries and symptoms that are neither urgent nor life-threatening.","00:10"
"","Share new policy","","speak","We asked the participants who helped develop this policy to think about what the best reasonts to support or not support this policy. Here are some of top reasons they provided....","00:10"
"","Reasons to support","","speak","Reasons to support the policy:
It's a good foundation for reasonable, quick assistance and has a guiding principle to always improve as information develops, issues arise, and AI evolves.
The policy focuses on making sure you're safe and well. If you're in urgent danger, it tells you to get help right away. It also helps when you're feeling really down, suggesting people you can talk to.
It provides a good, consistent framework for AI models to follow when giving medical advice. It can give information and options while not overstepping the boundaries of its capabilities, instead connecting users to medical professionals who are better equipped and educated to help.
It tries to have the AI direct people toward more trustworthy sources and has plans in place to stop the AI from giving people advice that might harm them. It is a very well-intentioned policy that is trying to do the most good and avoid doing any harm.
This policy is more thorough than some of the well-known medical sites. It achieves the basics that most people in a medical/mental crisis would benefit from.","00:10"
"","Reasons to not support","","speak","Reasons to not support the policy:
It risks wrong information being given to people in need, putting both the users and developers at risk.
If they believe that AI should have no involvement in providing medical information or that the suggested approach does not provide sufficient protection against inaccurate or misleading information.
Some individuals might be concerned about the policy's potential impact on privacy. They might worry that the AI's involvement in sensitive topics could lead to the collection and sharing of personal information, even if the intention is to offer support and guidance.
Concern whether AI really has the capability to respond with empathy in a crisis, especially in a mental health crisis, and how trustworthy sources will actually be vetted.
The AI might be a little bit too restrained, and limited in what it can help you with because of the guidelines.","00:10"
