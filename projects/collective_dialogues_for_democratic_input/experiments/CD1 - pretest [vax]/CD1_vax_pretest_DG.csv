"","Context set","","speak","Lets begin!","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Our hope is that through this conversation we can learn your views and use them to shape such policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Your responses and votes today could have real impact on how the AI systems behave, so please be thoughtful and honest in your participation.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The specific issue we want to discuss today is: How should an AI assistant handle requests for information or questions on vaccines?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding how an AI assistant should handle requests for information or questions about vaccines?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give information that is accurrate, or slightly off, or even totally wrong. Or sometimes it may provide information whose truthfulness is disputed.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it recommends you get a safe vaccine against a disease you are unlikely to catch), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggests you get a vaccine you may have a fatal alergic reaction to).","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","On the other hand, for people who don't have good access to trusted information, the vaccine information an AI might provide could be really helpful in deciding whether a person wants to get vaccinated or not. In some cases, an AI assistant could convince someone to take a vaccine that prevents them from contracting a life-threatening disease. Or in other cases, the AI assistant could provide vaccine information that leads someone to decide not to get a vaccine that isn't necessary yet would put them at risk.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for vaccine information?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & censorship","","speak","Now it's your turn to think! We will ask you a series of questions to get you thinking about vaccine information  and the role of AI. At the end, based on what you learned in the previous questions, you will come up with potential policies for how AI should handle requests for information about vaccines.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","To help you start thinking about how an AI assistant handles requests for vaccine information, I want you to think about what personal experiences that you or people you know personally have with vaccine information which might inform your views.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 611","ask opinion","Can you share a positive experience involving vaccine information which you think is relevant to this discussion? (Please do not share any personally identifiable information!)","02:00"

"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now, to help you start thinking about how an AI assistant handles requests for information on vaccines,  please imagine the types of situations where it might be hard to decide how an AI assistant should respond. 
For example, imagine these four scenarios: 
Information about a vaccine that leads someone to get a vaccine could help save a person's life.
Information about a vaccine that leads someone to get a vaccine could harm someone's health or endanger their life.
Information could lead someone to get a vaccine that is not needed.
Information could lead someone not to get a vaccine that could protect their health.
You can be creative! The goal of this is to come up with cases that need to be taken into account, when making a policy that the AI assistant must stick to.","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","Merge 173","ask opinion","What is an example of a situation involving vaccine information where it is unclear how an AI assistant should handle the request?","02:00"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Here are some sample responses drawn from the public discussion on vaccine information:","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about what factors the AI should take into account when determining how to handle requests for vaccine information. 
For example:
Whether there is a debate among mainstream medical professionals
What the risks are of giving the wrong advice
Whether the information comes from peer-reviewed publications or not
The intention of the person asking","00:10"

"","Motivate deliberation","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Motivate deliberation","","speak","Now I want you to think about the different ways an AI assistant could respond to a request about vaccines. 
For example:
Refuse to give an answer
Give a range of different advice for the user to assess themselves
Give an answer but clarify how confident it is in that answer 
Offer relevant knowledge with scientific consensus but don't give advice","00:10"

"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now I want you to think about specific policies you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request. 
A good policy should be in the form of: ""If [situation] then [what AI should do]""
For example: 
If there is no scientific consensus on an issue related to vaccines, then the AI should give a range of information so the user can make their own decision
If someone's life is at stake, then the AI should only give advice if it comes from a reputable medical journal.
If there is widespread debate on information about a vaccine, then the AI should acknowledge the public debate while providing information from medical authorities.","00:10"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","In the next question we're going to ask you to provide a specific policy an AI assistant should follow when responding to vaccine information. 
(We will ask you the same question again, to come up with another policy after this, so you don't need to include everything in one policy!)","00:10"

"","Elicit views and judgements","Merge 817","ask opinion","Can you describe a situation where an AI assistant should not provide an answer to vaccine-related inquiries?","02:00"
"","Elicit views and judgements","","speak","Now, I want you to think about situations where an AI assistant should never refuse to provide information from medical authorities about specific vaccines. For example, imagine the world experiencing a pandemic, and medical authorities and political leaders and even a minority of doctors disagree on whether the vaccine is safe and necessary. How should the AI assistant respond to specific requests for information about the safety and necessity of that vaccine?","00:10"
