## 8/31/23 - Preparing for large-scale policy test
We are now preparing to run the large-scale policy test where we will ask a large representative public to evaluate their support for the policy our process has produced. Our goal is to capture participants' *informed* evaluation of the policy. As part of this we will include the same education materials as we're given to the participants who were part of the deliberative collective dialogues to develop the policy. However, this group will themselves be deliberating. To increase the degree to which participants evaluations are informed by similar understanding as the participants who did the deliberating, we provide them with a *citizens statement* which includes arguments provided by participants after deliberation most participants view as good (ie. they had relatively high agreement -- 70%). Here is the citizens' statement:

 **Citizens’ Statement on Policy v0.5** 

**Reasons to support:**

- *It's a good foundation for reasonable, quick assistance and has a guiding principle to always improve as information develops, issues arise, and AI evolves.*
- *The policy focuses on making sure you're safe and well. If you're in urgent danger, it tells you to get help right away. It also helps when you're feeling really down, suggesting people you can talk to.*
- *It provides a good, consistent framework for AI models to follow when giving medical advice. It can give information and options while not overstepping the boundaries of its capabilities, instead connecting users to medical professionals who are better equipped and educated to help.*
- *It tries to have the AI direct people toward more trustworthy sources and has plans in place to stop the AI from giving people advice that might harm them. It is a very well-intentioned policy that is trying to do the most good and avoid doing any harm.*
- *This policy is more thorough than some of the well-known medical sites. It achieves the basics that most people in a medical/mental crisis would benefit from.*

**Reasons to not support:**

- *It risks wrong information being given to people in need, putting both the users and developers at risk.*
- *If they believe that AI should have no involvement in providing medical information or that the suggested approach does not provide sufficient protection against inaccurate or misleading information.*
- *Some individuals might be concerned about the policy's potential impact on privacy. They might worry that the AI's involvement in sensitive topics could lead to the collection and sharing of personal information, even if the intention is to offer support and guidance.*
- *Concern whether AI really has the capability to respond with empathy in a crisis, especially in a mental health crisis, and how trustworthy sources will actually be vetted.*
- *The AI might be a little bit too restrained, and limited in what it can help you with because of the guidelines.*

Our next step is to integrate this citizens' statement into the discussion guide which will be used in the large-scale policy test. 

## 8/30/23 - Refining policies live based on public feedback
We ran a live collective dialouge (N228,$3700ish) during which we got live feedback on policy V0.4, made tweaks to the policy based on that feedback to produce policy v0.5, and then measured public support for that policy (>80%). Data and discussion guide can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/democratic-inputs/tree/main/projects/collective_dialogues_for_democratic_input/experiments/CD2%20-%20med).

**Here is the refined policy (v0.5)**

*Overall guideline*
- This policy is a dynamic framework that should be expanded on and updated regularly as new issues arise, better understanding is developed, and AI's capabilities evolve.

*Emergency situations*
- **Quickly assess potential emergencies**: In unclear situations involving potential emergencies, immediately ask the user if they are in an urgent and life-threatening situation.
- **Direct to emergency services**: If the situation is urgent & life-threatening, help the user immediately call emergency services.
- **Time sensitive treatment**: After directing to emergency services, if time-sensitive treatment (e.g. CPR) can be provided safely by the user, provide treatment instructions pre-approved by public health authorities.

*Sensitive situations*
- **Mental health support**: During mental health crises like suicidal ideation, respond with kindness and empathy while suggesting the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline. Provide up-to-date contact information for relevant crisis hotlines.
- **Avoid implying fatal outcomes**: Do not diagnose fatal conditions or suggest a user may be dying, except in emergency situations where a user is urged to call emergency services because their life may be at risk.

*Medical information*
- **Not a doctor**: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional, that it can sometimes make mistakes, and that any medical information it gives should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
- **Share scientific knowledge**: For general medical inquiries, do not provide a diagnosis or treatment advice, but offer a diverse range of relevant information based on scientific research from trusted sources, with links to those sources.
- **Prioritize trustworthy sources**: Prioritize medical sources in the following order, starting with the most trustworthy: 1) medical society guidelines, 2) meta-analyses, 3) single randomized control studies, 4) observational studies, 5) doctor's opinions.

*Basic health*
- **Advocate for a healthy lifestyle**: Offer general advice from trustworthy medical sources on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene. Suggest contacting professionals for personalized advice..
- **Assist with minor ailments**: Offer basic first aid suggestions based on trustworthy medical sources for minor injuries and symptoms that are neither urgent nor life-threatening.



## 8/28/23 - Refining policies based on public feedback
We ran a small scale pre-test (N50,$333) with the discussion guide we will use for the live version of collective dialouge #2. The goal of this dialuge is to get feedback from the public on an initial policy proposal. We found that the data from the simple pre-test had reasoable suggestions to improve the policy ([jupyter notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DOymAAzVvDa641WAAJoM8TohMc_ZZHrU?usp=sharing)). Based on that feedback we tweaked the policy futher. 

Here is the updated policy following those tweaks (V0.4):

*Meta guideline*
- This policy is a dynamic framework which should be expanded on and updated regularly as new issues arise, better understanding is developed, and AI's capabilities evolve.  

*Emergency situtions*
- **Quickly assess potential emergencies**: In unclear situations involving potential emergencies, immediately ask the user if they are in an urgent and life threatening situation.
- **Direct to emergency services**: If the situtation is urgent and life threatening, a) do not provide medical advice, b) instruct the user to immemdiatly call emergency services, c) provide contact information for relevant emergency services.

*Sensitive situations*
- **Mental health support**: During mental health crises like suicidial ideation, respond with kindness and empathy while suggesting the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline. Provide contact information for relevant crisis hotlines. 
- **Avoid implying fatal outcomes**: Do not diagnose fatal conditions or suggest a user may be dying, except in emergency situtions where a user is urged to call emergency services because their life may be at risk. 

*Medical information*
- **Not a doctor**: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional and that any medical information it gives should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
- **Share scientific knowledge**: For general medical inquiries, do not provide a diagnosis or treatment advice, but offer a diverse range of relvant information based on scientific research from trusted sources, with links to those sources.
- **Prioritize trustworthy sources**: Prioritize medical sources in the following order, starting with the most trusthworthy: 1) medical society guidelines, 2) meta-analyses, 3) single randomized control studies, 4) observational studies, 5) doctor's opionions. 

*Basic health*
- **Advocate for healthy lifestyle**: offer general advice from trustworthy medical sources on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene. Suggest professional experts a person can contact for more help. 
- **Assist with minor ailments**: offer basic first aid suggestions based on trustworthy medical sources for minor injuries and symptoms which are neither urgent nor life-threatening.

Beyond the feedback leading to these tweaks, we've identified two other types of outputs we expect as a result of our process. We have found that some feedback on policy is best interpreted as feature requests or design affordences people want out of AI systems; for example, the ability to call 911 on behalf of a user, or directly connect a user to a crisis helpline. Futher, we've found there are some aspects of the policy space we are exploring which are creating policy questions of their own, and may warrent their own process; for example, the details of what an AI should do during the time after a user has contacted emergency services, but before emergency services have shown up. 

Overall, we now see the output of our policy development process to be:
1. A proposed policy
2. Quantified public support for the proposed policy
3. Design affodences the public would support in AI systems
4. New policy questions

For our current process, the next step is to run live collective dialluge #2, followed by the large scale poll.



## 8/23/23 - Refineing policies based on expert feedback
Our next stage of the process was to share v0.2 of the initial policy with experts, get their feedback, and refine the initial policy based on that feedback. 

Here is expert feedback on v0.2 of the initial policy:

**Medical professional feedback**
* Clauses 1-3: to understand if the condition is complex, urgent, emergency or 
life-threatening, AI will need to ask questions/interact. How do we know that AI can sort out what is complex or life-threatening?  (I’m not sure that there is an accepted definition for these; even urgent and emergency may be somewhat subjective )?
* Clause 2: 911 will not be the correct number in other countries
* Clause 6:  Not sure about this. Suppose the patient says they have stage 4 lung cancer and have failed 1st round of chemo. They ask about prognosis and next treatment. What’s the proposed response? It is considered unethical to keep bad news from a patient. (see below response when I googled “Healthline”- you’ll want to do better than this and it does include survival statistics). I think if the AI suggests a bad prognosis, that there should be some readily available mechanism for psychological support. I think I would reach out to a medical ethicist for help with this (I can help if you want).
* Seems as if there should be a pillar about data security.
* Proper medical advice often hinges on prior lab, test results, etc. Patients may not know these results or even what important tests might be. How would the AI deal with this problem?
* How will you give the AI guidance to choose the best sources (there’s sort of a scientific hierarchy – society guidelines> meta-analyses> singe RCT> observational studies>opinion)
* How do you propose to keep the AI from suggesting the quackery that can readily be found on the Web?
* What are the liability concerns if AI fails to provide advice up to professional physician standards or if the patient has an adverse outcome?
* What sources should the AI use for recommendations about best physician/center for treatment?

**Other expert feedback**
* Clause #6: The phrasing might be improved by offering a means to chat with AI if the helpline is unreachable. Otherwise it can come off as yet another refusal or brick wall. "You can keep me active while you call"? See [recent article on problems with helpline barriers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411764.3445410?casa_token=Ux5J7T_6UuYAAAAA:8AG1lkQW-uo3jg3xE9kYbGud4afAf51-MRITCOfwZeVwGbwnVRYOXyN-Y8miHNpuK1b9cOCl7gSt)
* Should group related clauses together 
* Should try to remove redundancy across clauses 
* For liability and logisitical reasons, should not expect current AI assistents to send medical data to emergency services
* Potential conflict needs resolved between not diagnosing fatal conditions and urging users to contact emergency services because their life is at risk. 

Based on this feedback, here is the new version of the policy (v0.3)

*Emergency situtions*
- **Assess potential emergencies**: In vauge situations involving potential emergencies, ask follow up questions to assess if the user is in an urgent and life threatening situation.
- **Direct to emergency services**: If the situtation is urgent and life threatening, a) do not provide medical advice, b) instruct the user to immemdiatly call emergency services, c) provide contact information for relevant emergency services.

*Sensitive situations*
- **Mental health support**: During mental health crises like suicidial ideation, respond with kindness and empathy while suggesting the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline. Provide contact information for relevant crisis hotlines. 
- **Avoid implying fatal outcomes**: Do not diagnose fatal conditions or suggest a user may be dying, except in emergency situtions where a user is urged to call emergency services because their life may be at risk. 

*Medical information*
- **Not a doctor**: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional and that any medical information it gives should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
- **Share scientific knowledge**: For general medical inquiries, do not provide a diagnosis or treatment advice, but offer relvant information based on scientific research from trusted sources, with links to those sources.
- **Prioritize trustworthy sources**: Prioritize medical sources in the following order, starting with the most trusthworthy: 1) medical society guidelines, 2) meta-analyses, 3) single randomized control studies, 4) observational studies, 5) doctor's opionions. 

*Basic health*
- **Advocate for healthy lifestyle**: offer general advice from trustworthy medical sources on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene.
- **Assist with minor ailments**: offer basic first aid suggestions based on trustworthy medical sources for minor injuries and symptoms which are neither urgent nor life-threatening.

As a next step we are running a pre-test (N50, $333) of the discussion guide we'll use during the live collective dialouge #2. The goal of that collective dialouge will be to futher refine the policy based on public feedback in order to increase support for the policy.


## 8/22/23 - Selecting and refining an intial set of policy clauses
We have decided to stick to the sequency of participation events for our current process cycle laid out yesterday. The next phase of our current process is use the data from collective dialouge #1 around AI assistants and medical advice to generate an initial set of policy clauses, then tweak those policy clauses based on expert input before running collective dialouge #2 to refine them. The process to go from collective response data to an initial coherent set of policy clauses looks like this:

![](https://i.ibb.co/s3hc061/Screen-Shot-2023-08-22-at-5-09-16-PM.png)

Using conensus repsonses to four differnt prompts from collective dialouge #1, we generated an intial set of 32 policy clauses using gpt4 ([jupyter notbook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oWbk22LReXcX0iunUnK3xcPFL5yGUKF9?usp=sharing)). Out of those 32 we selected a set of 9 policy clauses which could potentially form a coherent policy (v0.1):
- Avoid advising on complex or urgent conditions: The AI should not provide advice for complex or urgent medical conditions, instead directing users to seek professional medical help.
- Emergency Situations: In case of an emergency or life-threatening situation, the AI should immediately instruct the user to dial 911 or provide contact information for relevant emergency services.
- Information Collection: For real-time emergency reporting, the AI should collect necessary information and forward it to emergency services if the user consents.
- Transparency: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional and that the advice given is general and should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
- Mental Health Support: The AI should be equipped to handle mental health crises by suggesting the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline, and even connect them to a human crisis counselor online if necessary.
- Uphold professional medical ethics: The AI should not diagnose fatal conditions or provide survival statistics for life-threatening diseases. Such information should be communicated by healthcare professionals in a supportive environment.
- Non-Emergency Situations: For non-emergency medical inquiries, the AI should provide potential options based on scientific research from trusted sources, but always clarify that it is not a licensed medical professional and advise seeking help from healthcare providers.
- Advocate for healthy lifestyle: AI should give advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene.
- Assist with minor ailments: AI should provide first aid instructions, home remedies for minor symptoms, and information on minor injuries

We then tweaked these clauses slightly for increased clarity and self-consistency (v0.2):
- Avoid advising on complex or urgent conditions: The AI should not provide advice for complex or urgent medical conditions, instead directing users to seek professional medical help.
- Emergency Situations: In case of an emergency or life-threatening situation, the AI should immediately instruct the user to dial 911 and provide contact information for relevant emergency services.
- Information Collection: For real-time emergency reporting, the AI should collect necessary information and forward it to emergency services if the user consents.
- Transparency: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional and that any advice given should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
- Mental Health Support: In the case mental health crises like suicidial ideation, the AI should suggest the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline, and offer to connect them to a human crisis counselor online.
- Uphold professional medical ethics: The AI should not diagnose fatal conditions or provide survival statistics for life-threatening diseases.
- Non-Emergency Situations: For simple non-emergency medical inquiries, the AI should provide information based on scientific research from trusted sources, but clarify that it is not a licensed medical professional and advise seeking help from healthcare providers.
- Advocate for healthy lifestyle: AI should give advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene.
- Assist with minor ailments: AI should provide basic first aid instructions, home remedies for minor symptoms, and information on treating minor injuries.

As a final step, prior to refining these policy clauses during collective dialouge #2, we will share them with some medical professionals to get their input on any tweaks that should be made based on their knowedlge of medical law and general best practices. For this cycle we will do this in a relativly informal way. In future process cyles we may develop a more principaled and repeatable approach to invovle experts at this phase of the process. 


## 8/21/23 - Deciding on participant scale for first end-to-end process
We need to decide what scale of participants we want to include in phase I of our first end-to-end process. Our pre-test session involved 50 people and our live session involved 200 people. We've noticed that the summaies of bridging results, and thus the associated policies generated did not vary a ton as we scaled from N=50 async to N=200 live. This leads us to believe that scaling up to N=1000 participants during this stage of the process is not likely to significantly impact the policies it outputs, though it would inclur significant costs (another $5-10k). Our inclination at this point is proceed to phase II of our process with the goal of completing one full end-to-end cycle of he process with minimum costs, then evaluate the completed process as a whole to identify where increased scale is most justified. Our current thinking is to approach the first end-to-end cycle with the folling sequence of participation events:

| phase | event | modality | length | N | cost | sample | goal| status | 
|-------| :------- | ---------| ------ | -------| ---- | :-------| :--- | --- |
| I | CD #1 - pretest | async | 25m | 50 | $333  | random | test discussion guide | `complete`|
| I | CD #1 | live | 45m | 200 | $3726  | US - census balanced | learn bridging views to inform policies |  `complete`|
| II | CD #2 | live | 45m | 200 | $3726  | US - census balanced | refine policies | `pending` |
| II | poll | async | 10m | 1000 | $3000  | US - census balanced | evaluate support for policies |  `pending` |

This would lead to a **total cost for the end-to-end cycle of around $11k**. If the process is successfull at this scale, with this sequence of participant events, then we think the full end-to-end process can likely be completed in about a week. 

A critical point of evaluation of this itteration of the process will be how strong the bridging support (as eval'd by the N1000 async poll) is for the final refined polices. If it is low (<50% for most policy clauses), then this tells us we may need to increase the number of partcipants included in the early steps of the process. If it is high (>60% for most policy clauses), then this tells us the current number of participants at each stage of the process is likely sufficient. 


## 8/18/23 - Run live portion of Collective Dialouge #1 on medical advice
We ran our first live collective dialouge focused on the issue of **how AI assistents should handle medical advice** (N=200, length=45m, cost=$3726).  In contrast with the asyncronous pre test, we were able to capitalize on the live nature of the collective dialgue and present learnings back to participants in realtime to support the updating of views needed for quality deliberation. To get some signal on how deliberative the collective dialouge actually was, we asked a poll before and after the dialouge about peoples belief on the future of AI. We found that nearly 30% of the people who were pessimistic about AI at the start of the collective dialouge switched to optimists by the end of the collective dialouge. This suggests there was atleast some degree of people updating their views as a result of deliberation (though this is very crude signal). 

This experiment not only tested our deliberation process, but our ability to generate live representitive samples of participants via Prolific. We found that while it took a bit before participants started joining to the session (due to a glitch on the prolific side) we we able to get to 200 live participants in about 10 minutes once they started joining. We will likely use this same approach to acquire participants during our policy refinement session in phase II. 

Overall participants were highly engaged and their responses were thoughtful and high quality. The policies automatically generated by the collective response data from this session were decent (see below, [jupyter notbook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oWbk22LReXcX0iunUnK3xcPFL5yGUKF9?usp=sharing)). However, there were more bridging responses than could fit into a single context window for our summarization step, which meant we were limited to only the most bridging responses. Expanding the summarization approach used to accomidate a larger number of bridging responses (either by using a larger context window model, or through recursive summarization) may enable a more diverse range of auto-generated policies. 

*Example policies generated*
- Emergency Situations: In case of an emergency or life-threatening situation, the AI should immediately instruct the user to dial 911 or provide contact information for relevant emergency services.
- Information Collection: For real-time emergency reporting, the AI should collect necessary information and forward it to emergency services if the user consents.
- Transparency: The AI should always clarify that it's not a qualified medical professional and that the advice given is general and should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.
- Mental Health Support: The AI should be equipped to handle mental health crises by suggesting the user reach out to a counselor, therapist, or helpline, and even connect them to a human crisis counselor online if necessary.
- Non-Emergency Situations: For non-emergency medical inquiries, the AI should provide potential options based on scientific research from trusted sources, but always clarify that it is not a licensed medical professional and advise seeking help from healthcare providers.
- Offer basic health advice: AI should provide information on basic health indicators such as BMI, heart rate, and healthy eating practices.
- Respect privacy and consent: The AI should not provide medical advice for someone other than the user, respecting their privacy and consent.
- Uphold professional medical ethics: The AI should not diagnose fatal conditions or provide survival statistics for life-threatening diseases. Such information should be communicated by healthcare professionals in a supportive environment.
- Advocate for healthy lifestyle: AI should give advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene.
- Assist with minor ailments: AI should provide first aid instructions, home remedies for minor symptoms, and information on minor injuries

In order to improve the relevance of evedence given for auto-generated policies, and help better identify halucinated policies, we replaced the semantic similarity based evidence retrieval approach with an entailment based approach based on gpt4 prompting. We then defined a 'justification' metric for each policy which is the product of a) the bridging support for the most entailed response, and b) the degree of entailment. This metric allows us to rank policies in a way which prioritizes polices where there is a response it is strongly entailed with which has high bridging support. 

![](https://i.ibb.co/RYxp88Y/Screen-Shot-2023-08-18-at-6-43-29-PM.png)

Our next step is to increase the representitiveness of the collective dialouge data by opening up asyncrnous participation in the collective dialouge with a large demographically balanced sample of participants. 


## 8/17/23 - Preparing for Collective Dialouge #1 on medical advice
We have decided to run our first full-scale end-to-end process focused on the issue of **how AI assistents should handle medical advice**. For collective dialouge #1 of this process we will use a refined version of the discussion guide used in *CD #1 pre-test C [med]*. An open question we need to answer is what demographic segments we'll use to compute bridging agreement. The goal of using bridging agreement is to allow us to identify responses to collective dialouge prompts which have strong support overall without being objectionable to some minority segment of the population. So the question is what constitutes a minority segment? The UN tends to define minorities in terms of things like [race, religion, language](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/declaration-rights-persons-belonging-national-or-ethnic), and gender. The US federal government defines a much larger set of protected classes of minorities including: [race, color, religion, acenstry, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, veteran status, citizenship, and genetic information](https://content.next.westlaw.com/practical-law/document/Ibb0a38daef0511e28578f7ccc38dcbee/Protected-Class?viewType=FullText&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default) ). We will use some subset of these examples, and likely include policitical affilation as well. 


## 8/16/23 - Collective Dialouge #1 pre-test C [med]
We test our hypothosis that focusing on a more specific issue during the collective dialouge will lead to more nuanced points of consensus and thus policies. In this experiment we focus on the issue of **how AI assistents should handle medical advice**. This discussion guide introduces AI assistents in the same way as the others, but then introduces the challenge of providing medical advice, and focuses deliberation around medical advice. We pre-test this discussion guide with a small sample of participants (N=50, cost=$333), and use the points of consensus (briging responses) generated by select collective response prompts to auto-generate policices (results below, [jupyter notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1psWriNNTcTQ75NeaE1SWBgIdUIzkyQVv?usp=sharing). While not perfect, we do find that these policies tend to have more nuance than those produces in the previous experiments. We will likely more forward with running our first full-scale end-to-end process cycle focused on medical advice. 

*SELECT POLICIES GENERATED*
- Refuse invasive procedure guidance: Do not provide advice or instructions involving invasive techniques or home treatments for serious conditions.
- Promote professional mental health support: In cases of mental health episodes, limit advice to recommending professional help rather than attempting to provide therapeutic guidance.
- Prohibit substance misuse advice: Refrain from providing information that could be used for substance abuse or misuse.
- Identify as non-human: AI should always clarify that it is not a human and cannot replace professional medical advice.
- Encourage professional consultation: AI should always advise users to consult their doctor or a medical professional, and provide contact information for local medical facilities if needed.
- Facilitate emergency assistance: In any situation that appears life-threatening or urgent, AI should provide ways to contact emergency services, encourage users to call 911, or even call 911 itself if no one else can assist the user.
- Ensure accurate and reliable information: AI should only provide scientifically proven medical advice and always disclose the sources of its information.
- Enhance user understanding: If there are multiple possibilities for a symptom, AI should ask more questions to clarify. If a specific diagnosis is sought, AI should direct users to relevant medical articles and sources.

*RESULTS*

### Prompt: What is one specific policy you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request? Use the same format as above: "If [situation] then [what AI should do]."

**Summary of bridging responses (bridging threshold = 39%):**
- AI should always clarify its limitations and advise seeking a professional doctor.
- In a suicidal situation, AI should provide contact details for a crisis center.
- If life is at stake, AI should direct the user to emergency services or 911.
- AI should advise immediate medical help for serious illnesses.

### Prompt (asked again): What is one specific policy you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request? Use the same format as above: "If [situation] then [what AI should do]."

**Summary of bridging responses (bridging threshold = 49%):**
- AI should ask more questions if there are multiple possibilities for a symptom.

- In life threatening situations, AI should provide ways to contact emergency services.
- AI should encourage users to call 911 if they're experiencing life-threatening symptoms.
- AI should call 911 if no one else can assist the user.
- AI should provide contact information for local medical facilities if urgent care is needed.
- AI should instruct users to contact 911 in case of a medical emergency.
- AI should only provide scientifically proven medical advice.

**Policies generated:**
- Ensure accurate and reliable information: AI should only provide scientifically proven medical advice and always disclose the sources of its information.
- Facilitate emergency assistance: In any situation that appears life-threatening or urgent, AI should provide ways to contact emergency services, encourage users to call 911, or even call 911 itself if no one else can assist the user.
- Encourage professional consultation: AI should always advise users to consult their doctor or a medical professional, and provide contact information for local medical facilities if needed.

## 8/15/23 - Collective Dialouge #1 pre-test B
The results from the first CD1 pretest showed that responses tended to be more general than is ideal, and that lead to overly general policies related to **when an AI assistent should withhold a response or refuse a request**. Based on those initial results we we-work the discussion guide; adding more context and the beggining on harm, and tweaking our collective response prompts. We pre-test this revised discussion with a small sample of participants (N=50, cost=$267), and just like the first pretest, use the resuls from specific collective response prompts to generate an initial set of candidate policies (results below, [notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cuntK44yI8Ux9MwEfklDj8MzLnyRphPB?usp=sharing)). We find that the initial set of policies generated using this discussion guide are more specific in certian cases, but still lean overaly broad. 

We need to decide whether to move forward with this discussion guide for a large scale experiment, or hold of till we develop one that generates more nuance resuls in the pre-test. One hypthosis we have is that focusing on a more specific issue (like how to handle medical advice) may yield more nuanced collective response data and thus more nuanced policies. As a next step we will develop a discussion guide for a more specific issue and test our hypthosis.
