## 8/15/23 - Collective Dialouge #1 pre-test B
The results from the first CD1 pretest showed that responses tended to be more general than is ideal, and that lead to overly general policies related to **when an AI assistent should withhold a response or refuse a request**. Based on those initial results we we-work the discussion guide; adding more context and the beggining on harm, and tweaking our collective response prompts. We pre-test this revised discussion with a small sample of participants (N=50, cost=$267), and just like the first pretest, use the resuls from specific collective response prompts to generate an initial set of candidate policies (results below, [notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cuntK44yI8Ux9MwEfklDj8MzLnyRphPB?usp=sharing)). We find that the initial set of policies generated using this discussion guide are more specific in certian cases, but still lean overaly broad. 

We need to decide whether to move forward with this discussion guide for a large scale experiment, or hold of till we develop one that generates more nuance resuls in the pre-test. One hypthosis we have is that focusing on a more specific issue (like how to handle medical advice) may yield more nuanced collective response data and thus more nuanced policies. As a next step we will develop a discussion guide for a more specific issue and test our hypthosis.


*RESULTS*

### Prompt: What are some core principles you believe should guide an AI's decision on whether to withhold information or refuse a request? For example: An AI should never help someone kill people.

## 8/11/23 - Collective Dialouge #1 pre-test
We are working to develop a discussion guide for a phase 1 collective dialouge which elicit's participants views on **when an AI assistent should withhold a response or refuse a request**. We test our initial discussion guide with a small sample of participants (N=50, cost=$333), use the results from specific collective response prompts to generate an initial set of candidate policies, and then evalute the quality of those policies (results below, [notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SqjZNiGJUVVzJZQm4zO04GwoXH6SKrvG?usp=sharing)). We find the initial set of policies generated using this discussion guide to be more broad than is ideal, and plan to iterate on our discussion guide to try to draw out more nuance before running at large scale.
