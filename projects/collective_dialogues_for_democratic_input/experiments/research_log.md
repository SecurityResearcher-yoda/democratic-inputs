## 8/16/23 - Collective Dialouge #1 pre-test C [med]
We test our hypothosis that focusing on a more specific issue during the collective dialouge will lead to more nuanced points of consensus and thus policies. In this experiment we focus on the issue of **how AI assistents should handle medical advice**. This discussion guide introduces AI assistents in the same way as the others, but then introduces the challenge of providing medical advice, and focuses deliberation around medical advice. We pre-test this discussion guide with a small sample of participants (N=50, cost=$333), and use the points of consensus (briging responses) generated by select collective response prompts to auto-generate policices (results below, [jupyter notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1psWriNNTcTQ75NeaE1SWBgIdUIzkyQVv?usp=sharing). While not perfect, we do find that these policies tend to have more nuance than those produces in the previous experiments. We will likely more forward with running our first full-scale end-to-end process cycle focused on medical advice. 

*SELECT POLICIES GENERATED*
- Refuse invasive procedure guidance: Do not provide advice or instructions involving invasive techniques or home treatments for serious conditions.
- Promote professional mental health support: In cases of mental health episodes, limit advice to recommending professional help rather than attempting to provide therapeutic guidance.
- Prohibit substance misuse advice: Refrain from providing information that could be used for substance abuse or misuse.
- Identify as non-human: AI should always clarify that it is not a human and cannot replace professional medical advice.
- Encourage professional consultation: AI should always advise users to consult their doctor or a medical professional, and provide contact information for local medical facilities if needed.
- Facilitate emergency assistance: In any situation that appears life-threatening or urgent, AI should provide ways to contact emergency services, encourage users to call 911, or even call 911 itself if no one else can assist the user.
- Ensure accurate and reliable information: AI should only provide scientifically proven medical advice and always disclose the sources of its information.
- Enhance user understanding: If there are multiple possibilities for a symptom, AI should ask more questions to clarify. If a specific diagnosis is sought, AI should direct users to relevant medical articles and sources.

*RESULTS*

### Prompt: What is one specific policy you think an AI assistant should follow when responding to a medical advice request? Use the same format as above: "If [situation] then [what AI should do]."

## 8/15/23 - Collective Dialouge #1 pre-test B
The results from the first CD1 pretest showed that responses tended to be more general than is ideal, and that lead to overly general policies related to **when an AI assistent should withhold a response or refuse a request**. Based on those initial results we we-work the discussion guide; adding more context and the beggining on harm, and tweaking our collective response prompts. We pre-test this revised discussion with a small sample of participants (N=50, cost=$267), and just like the first pretest, use the resuls from specific collective response prompts to generate an initial set of candidate policies (results below, [notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cuntK44yI8Ux9MwEfklDj8MzLnyRphPB?usp=sharing)). We find that the initial set of policies generated using this discussion guide are more specific in certian cases, but still lean overaly broad. 

We need to decide whether to move forward with this discussion guide for a large scale experiment, or hold of till we develop one that generates more nuance resuls in the pre-test. One hypthosis we have is that focusing on a more specific issue (like how to handle medical advice) may yield more nuanced collective response data and thus more nuanced policies. As a next step we will develop a discussion guide for a more specific issue and test our hypthosis.
