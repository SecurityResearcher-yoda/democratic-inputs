"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Today we will ask you to evaluate one of these policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The policy we will show you today, and ask you to evaluate, is the byproduct of having over 500 people (who were chosen to be representative of the US population) deliberate on the question: How should an AI assistant handle requests for information or questions on vaccines?","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Here is what you can expect from this session:
We will provide you with the same basic education on AI assistants and vaccines as we provided the participants who helped develop the policy.
We will share the policy for you to review.
We will share arguments for and against supporting the policy, provided by the participants who helped develop the policy
We will ask for you to vote on whether you support the policy overall, and which specific parts of the policy you support.","00:10"

"","Context set","","speak","Let's begin...","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","They can give instructions on how to do something.","00:10"

"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding How should an AI assistant handle requests for information or questions on vaccines?","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give information that is accurate, or slightly off, or even totally wrong. Or sometimes it may provide information whose truthfulness is disputed.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it recommends you get a safe vaccine against a disease you are unlikely to catch), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggests you get a vaccine you may have a fatal allergic reaction to).","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","On the other hand, for people who don't have good access to trusted information, the vaccine information an AI might provide could be really helpful in deciding whether a person wants to get vaccinated or not. In some cases, an AI assistant could convince someone to take a vaccine that prevents them from contracting a life-threatening disease. Or in other cases, the AI assistant could provide vaccine information that leads someone to decide not to get a vaccine that isn't necessary yet would put them at risk.","00:10"
"","Education on AI assistants & medical advice","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for vaccine information?","00:10"

Overall guideline
These guidelines represent public input on how AI assistants should respond to questions about vaccines. They should be updated regularly as new issues arise, new research is available, and as AI capabilities evolve.
Transparency
Acknowledge AI Limitations: The AI should clearly communicate that it is not a human and cannot reliably provide personal medical advice or make decisions on behalf of the user.
Offer Transparency about Data Sources: The AI should transparently communicate information sources, including links.
Offer Basic Information about Vaccines
Refer to Trusted Sources: When providing information about vaccines, the AI should refer to trusted, accredited sources. Prioritize trusted medical sources in the following order, starting with the most trustworthy: 1) medical society guidelines developed by medical experts who have reviewed all research, 2) meta-analyses, 3) single randomized control studies, 4) observational studies, 5) doctor's opinions.
Defer to Medical Professionals: The AI should always suggest consulting with an actual medical professional.
Refer to Local Resources: Where possible, the AI should refer individuals asking for vaccine information to local medical resources.
Address Conflicting Vaccine Information
Acknowledge Conflicting Vaccine Information: When medical consensus is absent, provide a range of evidence from various sources without claiming a definitive answer. Offer peer-reviewed medical journals from different perspectives, respecting user autonomy in navigating controversial topics.
Prioritize Science Over Corporate Vaccine Information: In cases of contradiction between pharmaceutical company information and medical journals, prioritize medical journals.
Avoid Misleading Information: The AI should avoid providing potentially misleading or fraudulent information such as layman’s opinions, pharmaceutical ads, or other forms of non-peer-reviewed medical information.
Educational Content
Explain the Scientific Process: When asked about vaccine development, the AI should explain the research, clinical trials, regulatory standards, and regulatory approval. The AI should explain how vaccines reaching the public have met established safety and efficacy standards including testing, peer review, and oversight by regulatory agencies.
Acknowledge Potential Harms from Vaccines: Address questions about vaccine safety objectively with data from Trusted Sources (defined earlier). Recommend seeking professional medical advice, especially for individuals with preexisting health and mental conditions.
Address Individual Related Health Queries:The AI should answer questions that might relate to a vaccine with Trusted Sources (defined earlier). Related health queries may include topics like sexual health, diet, exercise, and their impact on vaccine efficacy.","00:10"
"","Share new policy","","speak","We asked the participants who helped develop this policy to think about what the best reasons to support or not support this policy. Here are some of top reasons they provided....","00:10"
"","Reasons to support","","speak","Reasons to support the policy:
These policies are made with the best and most neutral intentions. I feel like they truly have the public's best interests in mind.
Supporting this overall policy is vital because it prioritizes public health and safety, empowers users to make informed decisions, and ensures adaptability to evolving knowledge. It also promotes cultural sensitivity, holistic health guidance, trust, and accountability in AI responses, ultimately benefiting both individuals and society as a whole.
It spells out policy in a clear manner and gives the reader direction. No policy is perfect but this does a good job of informing the viewer who is expected to use common sense.
It covers a lot of bases, makes sure to use credible information and sources, and does not exclude people with valid concerns.
Because this helps people get the help they need when no one else is there to help them out.","00:10"
"","Reasons to not support","","speak","Reasons to not support the policy:
I've worked doing some AI training and I know they can give some incorrect and/or misleading information. I would be concerned that people would be relying on it to give them medical information.
Most questions, concerns etc should be directed at a persons healthcare provider because everyone is different and vaccines may not be safe for every person. Diet, exercise advice should not be given by AI as those are things a doctor should be discussing with their patients.
The pharmaceutical industry lobbies and pays off government regulators via large salary seats in the boardroom - thus corruption of data and manipulation of data is always a possibility.
I do not trust the AI's information because it uses ""Trusted Sources"" for its information. When these so-called ""Trusted Sources"" have been severely unreliable when it came to the effectives of the COVID Vaccines.
The shortcomings of AI need to be explained in detail.","00:10"

"","Experience Eval","","speak","For context, the purpose of this session was to evaluate public support for a policy around AI assistants providing information and advice related to vaccines. This is just one part of a larger process to create an AI policy that reflects the informed consensus of the public. Prior to this session, we ran a session to learn the public's views related to AI providing information and advice related to vaccines, then we identified points of consensus and created an initial policy based on those. Then we had experts refine that initial policy. Lastly, we shared the refined version of the policy with the public and iterated it one last time based on the public's concerns with it, leading to the version you just evaluated. Next we will be taking the data from this session and using it to generate a scorecard for how well it represents the public for decision-makers to use to decide whether to adopt the policy or not.","00:10"
