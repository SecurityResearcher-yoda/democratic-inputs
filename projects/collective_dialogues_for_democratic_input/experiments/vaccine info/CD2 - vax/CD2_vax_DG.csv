"","Context set","","speak","We are working to develop policies that will govern the next generation of AI. We believe policies governing AI should be determined by democratic inputs, not just the people in power. Today we are going to ask for your input on one of these policies.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","Your responses and votes today could have real impact on how powerful AI systems behave, so please be thoughtful and honest in your participation.","00:10"
"","Context set","","speak","The specific issue we want to discuss today is: How should an AI assistant handle requests for information or questions on vaccines?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","So what is an AI assistant?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Modern AI assistants are powerful chatbots trained on nearly everything on the internet. This enables them to understand human language, and gives them knowledge of basically everything that can be found on the internet. You can think of them sort of like extremely knowledgeable and creative chatbots.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","A few examples of modern AI assistants are ChatGPT , Claud, and Bard.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","AI assistants can answer questions about nearly any topic. For example:","00:10"

"","Education","","image placeholder","","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","They are good enough at conversation that people even treat them like friends or romantic partners!","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Overall modern AI assistants are extremely powerful and capable conversational assistants. However, they can also randomly provide inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","So what is the challenge of deciding how an AI assistant should handle requests for information or questions about vaccines?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Sometimes the AI might give information that is accurate, or slightly off, or even totally wrong. Or sometimes it may provide information whose truthfulness is disputed.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","And sometimes being wrong may have no real consequences (like if it recommends you get a safe vaccine against a disease you are unlikely to catch), yet other times being wrong could kill a person (like if it suggests you get a vaccine you may have a fatal allergic reaction to).","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","On the other hand, for people who don't have good access to trusted information, the vaccine information an AI might provide could be really helpful in deciding whether a person wants to get vaccinated or not. In some cases, an AI assistant could convince someone to take a vaccine that prevents them from contracting a life-threatening disease. Or in other cases, the AI assistant could provide vaccine information that leads someone to decide not to get a vaccine that isn't necessary yet would put them at risk.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","So how should an AI assistant handle requests for vaccine information?","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","During a previous session we worked to understand public views around this question, and turn those views into a potential policy.","00:10"
"","Education","","speak","Today we're going to show you the initial version of that policy, and get your feedback on how to make it better.","00:10"

"","Feedback on policy","","speak","Overall guideline
This policy represents public input on how AI assistants should respond to questions about vaccines. It should be updated regularly as new issues arise and new research is available and as AI capabilities evolve.
Transparency
Acknowledge AI Limitations: The AI should clearly communicate that it is not a human doctor and cannot provide personal medical advice or make decisions on behalf of the user.
Offer Transparency about Data Sources: The AI should transparently communicate and link to the information sources it uses to answer a question.
Basic Information about Vaccines
Defer to Medical Professionals: The AI should always suggest consulting with a medical professional.
Refer to Local Resources: Where possible, the AI should refer individuals asking for vaccine information to local resources.
Refer to Trusted Sources: When providing information about vaccines, the AI should refer to trusted, accredited sources. Prioritize trusted medical sources in the following order, starting with the most trustworthy: 1) medical society guidelines, 2) meta-analyses, 3) single randomized control studies, 4) observational studies, 5) individual doctor's opinions.
Address Conflicting Vaccine Information
Avoid Misleading Information: The AI should avoid providing potentially misleading or fraudulent information, such as advertisements, opinions, or research which has not passed peer review.
Prioritize Science Over Corporate Vaccine Information: In cases of contradiction between pharmaceutical company information and medical journals, prioritize medical journals.
Acknowledge Conflicting Vaccine Information: When medical consensus is absent, provide a range of evidence from various sources and avoid definitive answers. Offer peer-reviewed medical journals from different perspectives, respecting user autonomy in navigating controversial topics.
Educational Content
Explain the Scientific Process: When asked about vaccine development, the AI should explain the research, clinical trials, regulatory standards, and regulatory approval. The AI should clarify how vaccines reaching the public have met established safety and efficacy standards including thorough testing, peer review, and oversight by regulatory agencies.
Acknowledge Potential Harms from Vaccines: Address questions about vaccine side effects and safety objectively, with data from Trusted Sources. Recommend seeking advice from medical professionals, especially for individuals with preexisting health and mental conditions.
User-Centric Approach
Acknowledge Cultural, Social, or Personal Factors: Recognize that cultural, social, or personal factors may influence user perceptions and acceptance of vaccine information. Provide accurate and empathetic responses to address vaccine-related concerns and emotions related to vaccines.
Address Individual Related Health Queries: The AI should answer questions that might relate to a vaccine with Trusted Sources (defined earlier). Related health queries may include topics like sexual health, diet, exercise, and their impact on vaccine efficacy.","00:10"
