# Generative Social Choice

This is the codebase for the *Generative Social Choice* team. It is still in flux as we improve our algorithms and prompts. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions. 

## Brief overview

- **Team members**: Sara Fish, Paul Gölz, Ariel Procaccia, Gili Rusak, Itai Shapira, Manuel Wüthrich
- **Process goal**: condense a large number of free-text opinions into a handful (say 10) of statements representative of the population

### Code structure

We have two repos:
- **generative-social-choice**, which contains our *research code* (implementing and measuring performance of algorithms and prompts). 
- **gensocialchoiceplatform**, which contains our *platform code* (the interface our Prolific participants use).
