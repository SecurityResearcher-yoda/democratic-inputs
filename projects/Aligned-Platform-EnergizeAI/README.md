# Aligned: A Platform for Alignment

## Welcome to the Aligned Public Repository

We’re introducing Aligned, a new framework for deliberative inputs for AI via a platform. Aligned aims to set the foundation for a more open approach to the alignment of frontier models. We believe establishing a direct link between AI labs and communities, involving more people in a “constitutional committee for AI,” is essential to establishing safe AI for all of humanity.

We're open sourcing this grant process for other AI labs, teams, and companies to use and contribute to.

## About Energize AI

[Energize AI](https://energize.ai/) is a team from Harvard, MIT, and Cal Poly. We were selected by OpenAI for their [Democratic AI Grant](https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai) to work on alignment.

A special thanks to [X Community Notes](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for their input.

## Components

1. Platform Fronteend (/app): Collect public inputs via Energize Engine
2. Aggregation Module (/aggregation): X Community Notes-inspired bridging algorithm for identifying consensus
3. Taxonomy Builder Module (/taxonomybuilder): Refine a constitutional taxonomy

Backend functionality related to the collection of inputs from users are largely handled by the Energize Engine.

## Aligned Report

We're about to publish a public report detailing the background, approach, and experimentation that motivated this process.

## Notice

This repository contains files that are planned for open source/OpenAI usage as part of the [Democratic Inputs Grant program](https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai). These files will likely be moved to the OpenAI Organization's repository for release in October 2023. An initial transfer is occurring on the night of October 12, 2023.
