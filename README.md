# OpenAI Democratic Input Grant Repository

The [Democratic Inputs to AI grant program](https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai) funded 10 teams to develop and test their ideas for processes to help govern AI. We summarized some of their findings in our recap blog post, and here we present a repository where they have shared their code, alongside links to their reports and contact information.

If you would like to see the teams describe their ambitions during the September 2023 OpenAI Demo Day, please watch the [recording here](https://vimeo.com/875039398/c777de0595).
